        "Management Framework for Business Projects (MFBP) seeks to establish rigorous theoretical foundations for the initiation and management of projects (and programs) in business. MFBP explores concepts that are intended to enhance the success of projects by guiding the way they are initiated, scoped and governed.",
        "The Course introduces a set of frameworks and examines a number of contemporary issues in project management within the public and private sectors. While we refer to accepted project management practice (as reflected, for example, in the Project Management Body of Knowledge), this Course is based on an exploration of rigorous management principles - it is not a training program in any particular methodology. Indeed, armed with the theoretical principles that we will explore, it is possible to make considered judgements about the worth, strengths and weaknesses of the proprietary methodologies in common use throughout industry today.",
        "The focus of the Course is on the project as a domain of management decision-making. A number of important tools and techniques in project management that are covered comprehensively in other Courses are discussed only superficially in MFBP. This is particularly the case with such areas as: work planning, task scheduling, and project resourcing. Conventional wisdom in project management is based on a rich and fascinating collage of: analytical techniques, accepted practice, proprietary products, agreed standards, regularised procedures, anecdotal evidence, folklore, urban myths, professional ritual, assertions, strongly-held beliefs and methodological zealotry. The course discusses the theoretical foundations of project management."

        "This course introduces students to a new approach to the study of diplomacy and world politics. Historically, diplomatic studies has been a\u00a0theory-light if not atheoretical field, with diplomatic history and diplomat's memoirs serving as the standard reading material for the field . Over the past two decades, however, the field of diplomatic studies has experienced a transformation. The up-close study of who diplomats are and what they do has emerged as the empirical launchpad for a theoretically ambitious and sophisticated approach to the study of international politics. Better known by the labels \"practice turn\" and \u201cinternational political sociology,\u201d this avowedly sociological sensibility aims to bring abstract international politics (a world of states and free floating norms and identities) down to the trenches of everyday life and lived experiences. This approach draws on sociologists and anthropologists to show how domestic politics, everyday action, and social structures of class, race, and gender shape inequality, stratification, agency, and power in world politics. This new turn has not only put\u00a0diplomatic studies on the map of disciplinary IR, it has also attracted a new generation of scholars who are pushing the boundaries of how to study world politics using new theories and methods, and working in new regional and historical contexts. This course surveys this importantsociological shift in the study of diplomacy by introducing students to its\u00a0key thinkers, writings, and unfolding debates."

For some parts of the region, difficult twentieth-century histories have been left behind in favour of a more integrated, prosperous and peaceful future. However, authoritarian rule, lingering animosities, persistent inequalities and unstable polities have the potential to generate regional and even global impacts. There are many ways and many entry points into the scholarly exploration of this complex and fascinating region. Through the broad lens of activism and social change, this course will explore a range of disciplinary and case study perspectives to develop a better understanding of key institutions, issues, movements, and patterns of change in the modern Asia-Pacific. Lectures and readings will highlight relevant issues across Asia and the Pacific including case studies from East Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia, and the Pacific Islands. Lecturers will also offer insights into disciplinary and methodological approaches to analysing complex social science concepts. These may include rights, power, legitimacy, social control, social movements, economic patterns, gender, media, and the family."

And how can those who wish to write fiction navigate a landscape where the novel has been declared dead, and the study of literature is allegedly in a state of crisis? Advanced Creative Writing\u00a0examines and enters into discourse about the significance of literary and genre fiction, and disputes about the category of value in interpretative methods. Students discuss a series of texts which engage with ideas about literary value, including independent literary journals, and read fiction that dramatises questions about the novel's status, or makes arguments about creative work's restorative powers in times of crisis. The course requires students to write a creative piece about a subject, and in a genre, of their own choice, and a response to a novel or theoretical text. Together, the creative piece and the response will constitute a position statement about literary value. The course will culminate in the design, editing and publication of a literary journal composed of students' revised work, and edited by peers."

From environmental crises, disability and queer recognitions and reckonings, technological advancement and threat, and the growing consensus that current models of justice and criminality lack culturally contextual relevance to a Southern society, it is apparent criminology is changing, provoking need for new theoretical understandings. In this course, theory is discussed and analysed for suitability in combating these emergent harms and problems. Key theoretical insights are explored as we examine the social, political, and cultural intersections that have led us to this point, and how we must use theory to understand what criminology and the criminal justice system must face in the future."

While in tropical rainforests, they have evolved to deal with wet, often dark conditions where they rarely encounter other members of their own species. Finding suitable places to settle, grow and reproduce is a challenge. In both environments plants and animals have evolved special morphologies, physiologies and behaviours that influence the way they interact with other species, and that allow them deal with extreme conditions.",

Working with practitioners, students develop independent field research projects in plant and animal ecology.

        "Plants and animals from cold alpine environments have evolved strategies to enable them to survive freezing temperatures and short growing seasons. While in tropical rainforests, they have evolved to deal with wet, often dark conditions where they rarely encounter other members of their own species. Finding suitable places to settle, grow and reproduce is a challenge. In both environments plants and animals have evolved special morphologies, physiologies and behaviours that influence the way they interact with other species, and that allow them deal with extreme conditions.",

Objects can be imaged in 2D or 3D with various probes including electromagnetic radiation, particles, and acoustic waves. Advanced imaging is becoming increasingly important, producing imaging systems with significantly enhanced capabilities such as in ground-penetrating radar, magnetic resonance imaging, synthetic aperture radar, hyperspectral imaging, and computed tomography.While this unique course will cover conventional imaging techniques, the focus will be more on advanced imaging for specific applications.

The corresponding techniques are built on models of decision-making by economic agents, in environments with and without uncertainty, and on the analysis of interacting economic agents, in various settings such as markets or strategic situations. This course introduces the main techniques of microeconomics, at a level that lies between that of typical undergraduate courses, and that of Masters or PhD level courses. The results are presented and analysed using both intuitive graphical and formal mathematical methods. An important aim of the course is to show that the intuition gained from simple graphical models, and the insight derived from formal theoretical analysis are complementary, and that only the interplay between economic intuition and abstract results can lead to a complete understanding of the respective models and the conclusions drawn from their analysis."

Students will gain the skills to carry out an original research project, and will be guided through the development of this project through scaffolded assessment.\u00a0The course is important for students who are interested in conducting further study in sociolinguistics, or who would like to gain a better understanding of language in its social context."

Readings include short stories, poems, plays, and essays from Spain and Latin America. Lectures will be built around significant literary moments which outline the general trajectory of trans-Atlantic literature, as well as the key historical moments from which they stem. The readings are focused on the rhetorical strategies of writers to infer socio-cultural context to challenge the norms of the time and place in which they live(d). Topics covered will include various literary movements, the social and political construction of ethnic identities, and women\u2019s changing roles. In this course, students will analyze literary works through a critical lens, and will be asked to focus on both form and content through written and oral evaluations.

This course consists of three major sections: human-machine relationships, aviation labour, and finally aviation consumers/passengers. Drawing upon engineering history and human-machine relationships, using critical theories from social geography and anthropology, this course considers how aviation developed in relation to other forms of transportation and surveillance, as well as how \u201chuman factors\u201d discourses are used to assess aviation disasters. Next, it will examine aviation labour, with approaches from gender studies, to consider the highly sexualised, sometimes Orientalised icon of the flight attendant. Even though they are marketed as paragons of femininity, how do Thai Airways flight attendants use Buddhist philosophy to cope with the stresses of their job? Finally, the consumers of aviation: passengers and cargo. How has the container revolution changed our tastes in foods? How have the demographics of the flying public changed? How have marketing strategies and loyalty programs sought to segment elites? How has the COVID pandemic affected supply chains as well as aviation labour and consumerism? Through this course, students explore the histories, laws, economies and cultures as they come together in the machines, labour, and consumers that form the aviation industry today."

        "An applied economic analysis of a potential policy change will typically incorporate both positive and normative elements. The positive aspects of such an analysis involve an assessment of the likely impacts of the proposed policy change.

Since a potential policy change might make some individuals better off and other individuals worse off, any assessment of the desirability of such a policy change will require both the measurement of the changes in the welfare of individuals in society that might result from the proposed policy change, and the aggregation of those impacts into some measure of the resulting change in social welfare.

        "This course is designed to provide students with a strong background in the archaeological history of Oceania, a region with 50,000 years of human chronology within the classical divisions of Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia. We will discuss the case of Australia only in relation with the Pleistocene settlement of Sahul continent. Likewise, insular Southeast Asia will be considered solely through the Austronesian migrations from which originated the prehistoric Pacific cultures. We will tackle a wide range of anthropological questions with a holistic approach, using concepts from archaeology, linguistics, comparative ethnography, physical anthropology and biology. A significant portion of the course will be dedicated to the examination of the timing and process of prehistoric colonization in Oceanic islands and archipelagoes, using examples from the Lapita culture in the West Pacific as well as Polynesian cultures in the East. Regional chronocultural sequences will also be analyzed in detail. Finally, we will round out the course by addressing a variety of themes including the evolution of socio-political complexity, religious architecture, funerary practices, settlement patterns, subsistence practices, human-ecosystem interactions within island environments, and material culture and technology. Special topics including traditional oceanic navigation will also be presented throughout the semester. Topics discussed through presentations in tutorials will complete the lecture program."

The human body is examined in its myriad states: anatomised and whole, dead and alive, healthy, diseased and disabled, naked and dressed, real and ideal. Attention is paid to the various ways the body has been sexed and gendered through artistic representation, along with the way artists have challenged and reinforced gendered binaries and stereotypes through creative practice. Cross-cultural perspectives will work to de-centre dominant Euro-American models of the normalised human body, while a transdisciplinary approach will allow for an examination of the representation of the human body across art, science, medicine, and beyond.\u00a0We take an object-based approach, with students being encouraged to find images and objects of interest to them for focused examination.

        "Advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a catalyst for social, economic, scientific, political and legal change in our time. AI powers machine learning, natural language processing, sentiment analysis and complex autonomous systems operating in different domains. Each of these has ramifications for the law and society. The use of algorithmic decision-making and predictive coding by government and in the courts are cause for concern. Future lawyers and other professionals will need to understand the benefits and risks associated with the use of different types of AI in all aspects of social interaction, governance, compliance, risk analysis and business opportunities. The role of AI in social relationships of trust has been explored in science fiction and popular media. Its impact on the markets, elections, global health trends and human relationships is not to be underestimated.

Through interdisciplinary exploration, students will explore key themes including tradition and modernity, poverty and riches, ethnicity and gender dynamics, as well as beliefs, creativity and performance. Indigenous perspectives are a major element of the course, with an emphasis on views from Indigenous Australians. These themes offer insights into the ongoing shifts in power dynamics in Asia and the Pacific, the impact of regional transformations on the global geopolitical landscape, and the digital revolutions shaping the region. The course also analyses significant economic growth disparities and economic interdependence across the region and its subnational components, as well as the strategic importance of cultural expression in fostering social cohesion and national identity.",

The course emphasises the importance of inter-referencing within the region to demonstrate how concepts and theories originating from Asian and Pacific contexts are relevant on a translocal scale. Experts from across the ANU will raise big questions and comparative case studies in lectures, while tutorials will provide opportunities for students to develop the skills of critical thinking and effective communication.",

We explore of some of the major forces and dynamics shaping the region, and how these are experienced across national and local contexts. We begin by introducing the idea of Area Studies as a field of scholarship, asking what it means to study Asia and the Pacific. We then trace the history of big forces like colonialism, post-colonialism and decoloniality, and capitalism. We examine the ongoing legacies of these processes. We also examine people's interactions with their environment and the changes to urban and agrarian landscapes and livelihoods, before investigating the dynamics of development discourse, democracy, power and resistance, processes of nation-making, and diaspora communities and multiculturalism.",

        "Students will engage with classic debates on whether cases of environmental violence are best understood as connected to the dynamics of resource degradation, poverty and scarcity, or the mechanisms of extraction and unequal distribution of resource-based wealth in a globalised economy. Notions of environmental conflict and violence are situated as a \u201c... site-specific phenomenon deeply rooted in local histories and social relations, but also connected to transitional processes of material change, political power relations and historical conjuncture\u201d (Peluso and Watts, 2001). The insights of environmental security are used to situate how environmental conflicts can become critical threats to human well-being, while also understanding the limits of \"securitisation\" discourse.",
        "The course also engages in people's responses to environmental degradation and injustice, through a sustained engagement with environmental social movements and resistance. The course applies these ideas to a series of case studies around the Asia-Pacific region, including Australia. The cases explore conflicts that mobilise Indigenous rights, minority rights, states, and resource industries; inter-state conflicts over resources; and conflicts over regional or global commons.",
        "Finally, the course positions how the prospect of disruptive anthropogenic climate change has ushered in a new discourse of systemic or multiplying threats, raising concerns over the security of critical resources, ecosystems and infrastructure. In this context, the course explores how progressive actors and civil society institutions are attempting to counter trajectories towards intensified resource conflicts, in pursuit of environmental justice."

Therefore, it is not easy to view Asian capital markets through a single lens. However, this course not only introduces students to capital markets in various Asian countries but also attempts at introducing a unified conceptual framework to understand markets in these countries. The framework focuses on institutional environments (such as legal systems) in different countries and their impacts on corporate behaviour. We also present empirical evidence that such a framework might not necessarily explain the recent developments in China and India. Two of the important features in Asian capital markets, which contrast those of capital markets in UK-US, are the roles played by the State and closely tied families, which we will discuss in detail. The globalization of the world economy in the past two decades has affected the developments of Asian capital markets.

These include shifting the goal beyond GDP to broader measures of sustainable development and human well-being; understanding the importance of economic and political systems beyond the textbook 'free market'; recognising the critical role of governments in supporting equitable and regenerative development; and questioning whether the 20th-century obsession with economic growth is compatible with 21st-century development challenges.",

Why are some countries highly developed while others struggle to lift their most disadvantaged citizens out of poverty? Why are some democratic, others authoritarian, and still others prone to frequent shifts back and forth from one regime type to another? Why are some countries effectively centralized yet others decentralized with sub-national enclaves lorded over by heavily armed local bosses? Why are political parties strong and coherent in some settings but weak and incoherent elsewhere? Within what political contexts do we observe the rise of populist charismatic leaders and why? What is the impact of regional fissures, as expressed either in voting patterns or (at the other extreme) secessionist movements? What motivates efforts to reform democratic structures, and where have reforms been most effective in achieving their goals?

        "The Pacific Islands region has long been of strategic importance to Australia, and Australia has played a significant role in addressing the security and development challenges in and to the region. The region faces non-traditional security challenges, including human security and the gendered dimensions thereof, climate change, environmental and resource security, transnational crime, and cybersecurity. Given the diversity of the region, these challenges affect Pacific Island states in different ways, and require varied responses. Australia is the largest donor to the region, and is a member of the Pacific Islands Forum. With the escalation of geostrategic competition, more partners have engaged with the region, creating a \u2018crowded and contested\u2019 security environment with increased militarisation and development assistance. Pacific Islands states are actively forging their own way, defining their own security priorities and avoiding becoming a \u2018pawn\u2019 between great powers. This has led to contested notions of security in the region, between the \u2018Indo-Pacific\u2019 and \u2018Blue Pacific\u2019 constructions. This course examines Australia\u2019s history and traditional security and development role in the region; the range of security challenges facing the region and responses; differing understandings of security between Australia and Pacific Island states; and the implications for Australia\u2019s engagement with Pacific Island governments and societies. Through innovating and practical teaching methods, this course will enable students to understand how Australia engages presently with the Pacific Islands region, and consider how it might engage with emerging security challenges in the future."

        "'The era of global warming has ended. The era of global boiling has arrived.' So announced United Nations Secretary general Antonia Guterres in 2023. This course considers how artists and designers, with a particular focus on Australian and Australian First Nations artists including practitioners here at the ANU,   have responded to the ongoing ecological destruction of the planet. It will consider the art historical context for the emergence of the environmental art and design movement as well as giving an insight into contemporary developments in this vital area of research and practice."

        "Australia has a unique environment and a distinctive set of environmental policy issues including continued resource extraction, transitions to renewable energy, and movements for First Nations sovereignty. This course explores Australian environmental policy through the lens of problems, practices, and politics. Drawing on skills and methods from critical policy studies, the course follows a case-based learning approach to collaboratively explore policy issues such as: developing northern Australia, Indigenous Land and Sea Management, the Great Barrier Reef, management of invasive species, and renewable energy. Cases will vary year on year, and students will hear from guest speakers and policy practitioners active in each field, including First Nations perspectives. In addition, students will be encouraged to share practical experiences in relation to each case study, make comparisons with the treatment of similar issues in Australia and internationally, and use course tools to strengthen their critical thinking and practice in relation to their own environmental policy field of interest."

How the balancing of these might vary, both over time and geographically, is discussed. The roles of specialist knowledge, evidence, ideology and morality in the Indigenous policy arena are also discussed, while introducing a \u2018three accounts\u2019 approach to policy and governance. The course then examines a number of policy sectors which are central to recent debates in the Indigenous policy arena. These may change over time but could include: income support, alcohol, child protection, health, housing, land and education. Different sectors are used to think about various aspects and patterns of Indigenous policy processes, such as relations between Indigenous\u2013specific and general policy mechanisms, the changing balancing of competing principles and the differential involvement in various sectors of the levels of Australian government.\u00a0Recent experiments in \u2018mainstreaming\u2019 and whole-of-government policy will also be explored, both for their strengths and limitations. Finally we look at the ideas of failure and success in Australian Indigenous policy and how they relate to rhetorical registers and generational dynamics."

It examines how factors such as identity and views on the role of government drive political attitudes and behaviour, and considers how these have been changing over time. Through the framing of the role of government, major historical and contemporary political debates in Australia will be covered, including taxation, social security, health care, education, migration, economic policy, and the outcomes and rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. This course also dedicates attention to formal political institutions, paying particular attention to the constitution, institutions of government (e.g. High Court, Parliament, federalism, and the Australian Public Service), and electoral competition. We will also compare Australia to other advanced democracies, in order to shed light on what factors make Australia distinct and how Australia compares to its international peers."

The study of Australian Public Law at a relatively early stage in JD studies will open a pathway into a range of additional law courses and opportunities, and to thinking about opportunities beyond the JD too. To that end, LAWS 6105 has a strong focus on foundational aspects of the discipline of Australian Public Law.",

The wide-ranging impact of Australian Public Law on the Australian legal system and on Australian\u00a0governmental, judicial and social activities means that a basic knowledge of the terminology, institutions, and substance of Australian Public Law is not only worthwhile acquiring in its own right, but is also a necessary part of the knowledge and skills of any law graduate, and of any citizen of a democratic society. This makes Australian Public Law of considerable interest, whether you choose to go into the private practice of law, to work as a government or public lawyer, or are undertaking a law degree because you consider it will be useful in another career.

This course provides a whole-of-government focus to address these national security challenges, and offers theoretical grounding with deep policy-maker engagement to enable students to establish theoretically grounded and empirically supported policy proscriptions and prescriptions. The first half of the course focusses on more traditional issues including the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific, the U.S.-Australia alliance and other partnerships and agreements, conventional defence and deterrence and nuclear weapons, deterrence and related threats. The second half of the course focusses on newer threats and how they mesh with older challenges. It includes geoeconomics, critical technologies, cyber and contemporary challenges in Australia\u2019s maritime inner arc and the Pacific. These foci of Australia\u2019s current strategic environment will be taught by an integration of scholarly and contemporary policy-maker perspectives. The course also involves a whole of class interactive and dynamic wargame that models pressing challenges, risks, threats and opportunities in Australia\u2019s strategic environment to further illustrate the myriad of national security challenges that characterise Australia\u2019s strategic environment."

Among these data, genes, transcripts, and epigenetic features play a central role. Making sense of the rapid and large-scale data acquisition of today's genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and other -omics projects poses the major challenge of modern biology. Analyses of these data relies on advances in bioinformatics and statistics.",
        "As computer literacy is central to bioinformatics, it is also central to this course. Accordingly, the course includes a brief review of the Python programming language. We further cover advanced work practices employed during bioinformatics research, including code testing and version control systems. Research topics covered will include techniques for sequence comparison, population and comparative genomics.",

        "Indigenous peoples of Australia are the oldest living (surviving) culture in the world. In Australia, the Indigenous call for a \u2018Voice\u2019, Treaty and Truth-telling requires us to re-frame and reconstruct institutionalised governance systems, and to re-assert the legitimacy of Indigenous peoples' self-governance. Governance systems have often applied westernised models of \u2018good governance\u2019 to Indigenous communities in Australia, and globally. This course investigates the models and effectiveness of Indigenous-led governance systems, or in the Wiradjuri language,Biyam-burru-wa-la-nha:'the rules of governing'. This course examines how these intersect with non-indigenous governance systems in Australia and in comparative jurisdictions such as Canada and Aotearoa-New Zealand. Looking at case-studies that include first contacts between First Peoples and colonial powers, and contemporary settings such as the Kimberley region, Western Australia and the Murray-Darling Basin in NSW, the course asks how do governance arrangements in particular settings facilitate Indigenous normative practices and community autonomy? How responsive are Indigenous and non-Indigenous governance systems to international norms, principles and laws?",
        "This interdisciplinary Indigenous-led course draws on Indigenous standpoints, Indigenous ontology and epistemology, critical Indigenous theory, Indigenous rule of laws, comparative law, public policy, law, regulation, domestic and international law. It provides students with practical skills and intellectual insight to understand and develop Indigenous-centred methodologies to: evaluate the relevance and purpose of Indigenous-led governance systems and to facilitate respectful, effective relationships with Indigenous Australia."

We will be surveying popular beliefs and meanings, everyday practices and social consequences, surrounding human physicality during the early modern period, particularly in terms of their relation to class, sexuality, gender, ethnicity, and race. Of equal importance will be the issues of how (and why) historians go about recovering the history of the body.

With this, Papua New Guinea and Bougainville enter an unprecedented phase in their history. How did this happen? Where does it lead? How does what has happened in Bougainville relate to the broader context of Papua New Guinea, Melanesia and the region? These are challenging and as yet not fully answered questions now faced by Bougainvilleans, Papua New Guineans, and also their neighbours, including Australia. This course aims to provide its participants with a strong knowledge base from which to understand and participate in the conversations now taking place regarding the future of Bougainville.",

We will follow the history of the Bougainville conflict, orkraisis, and the decade-long search for peace, and compare the development of these political movements and those elsewhere in PNG. Careful attention will be paid to the political dynamics in the period after the establishment of the Autonomous Bougainville Government, to seek to understand how a once radical position became de facto government policy. Finally, we will examine the referendum vote itself and its implications.",

        "Since the time of the Buddha, Buddhists have developed a rigorous and profound tradition of philosophy. The Buddhist path consists in the combined practice of philosophical reasoning, ethical practice and meditation. This course will focus on philosophical reasoning (but may incorporate some meditation). For Buddhists, enlightenment is attained by gaining insight into the nature of reality (metaphysics), knowledge (epistemology), language (philosophy of language) and our ways of living (ethics). These insights are acquired, in large part, by subjecting our beliefs to rational scrutiny. In this course, we critically examine some of the core issues in metaphysics, epistemology, philosophy of language and ethics that are elaborated by Buddhist philosophers. The course proceeds by analyzing some core texts of Buddhist philosophy (in English translation) together with some secondary literature. We study Buddhist philosophy not as an item of historical and cultural interest but as an attempt to ascertain how much truth lies in this system of thought. Once we gain an understanding of the views expounded by Buddhist philosophers, we will subject their doctrines to rational scrutiny."

        "This course aims to provide an advanced understanding of how law and regulation relate to current debates about corporate responsibility and business respect for human rights standards. What would constitute an ideal regulatory and remedial framework on the human rights impacts of business activity? What commercial, political or social forces and factors shape these issues in practice?Delivered online, this course analyses the source, nature, content and practical significance of legal, regulatory, self-regulatory and other frameworks governing the ways in which business actors and activities might affect human rights. Framed by an understanding of the position in public international law, the course turns mainly on the significance of the 2011 UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, while addressing the range of regulatory options.From law suits for alleged corporate complicity in apartheid and other grave crimes, to examples of voluntary business leadership on addressing human trafficking, this course combines a commitment to objectivity and conceptual clarity with an emphasis on robust and informed student exchange. Approaching from a legal and regulatory perspective, the course addresses complex, controversial issues such as allegations of rights abuse in global food or manufacturing supply-chains; how global telecoms companies manage customer service in repressive states; and extractive industry stakeholder relations in conflict-affected regions. Through practical case studies students will be exploring the nexus of two of the most profound social and regulatory phenomena of our time: economic globalisation, and the international human rights narrative.The course is of relevance to policymakers, regulators, corporate and financial executives, those in civil society, the media, and the legal profession. Any contemporary study of international relations or international law is incomplete without going beyond states to consider the influence of transnational business and investment actors. Likewise, the private sector operates in a public world so that business scholars must factor in the increasing salience of corporate responsibility and accountability issues. Meanwhile, governmental actors are not the only source of human rights promotion: what positive role exists for the private sector?The course emphasises transnational commercial networks and regulatory responses, but makes some reference to Australian scenarios. Through moderated discussions and with occasional guest expert input, students navigate some key issues. How can business activity affect the enjoyment of human rights? How effective are existing regulatory responses, and what undermines these? What is the role for business self-regulation, and what is the state\u2019s duty to control the social impacts of a business operating abroad? What avenues of remedy exist or could or should exist? Should we pursue a binding treaty in this field, how likely is this, and what would it include? What particular responsibilities accompany investment decisions in repressive or conflict-affected states?"

        "This course offers an introduction to Cantonese with an emphasis mainly on communicative ability and partly on comparison with Mandarin Chinese (Putonghua). It is designed for students who have no or very limited prior knowledge of the Cantonese language. Students will learn the basics of Cantonese in this course, including pronunciation, the Cantonese Romanisation systems, vocabulary and structures for basic communication. Upon completion of the course, students are expected to have high-elementary to low-intermediate Cantonese proficiency and have the confidence to converse in Cantonese on everyday topics such as greetings, asking and giving directions, making phone calls and appointments, telling time, shopping and bargaining, describing weathers and seasons, and similar topics. As Cantonese shares a character writing system with Mandarin Chinese (Putonghua) and the majority of the Cantonese lexicon are identical or similar to the Mandarin equivalents, the focus of this course is on the acquisition of lexical items and syntactical structures that are unique in Cantonese and on the practice of Cantonese speaking and listening.

        "This course is a continuation of Cantonese 1. Built on the fundamental Cantonese language skills taught and trained in Cantonese 1, Cantonese 2 is designed to cultivate students' Cantonese communicative skills to a high-intermediate to low-advanced level. The course emphasis will be placed on developing speaking skills in daily communication and enhancing competence in listening comprehension. Students will develop the abilities to engage in elaborate conversations, describe surroundings and activities, discuss featured topics, and express opinions in Cantonese. This course also aims to contextualize Cantonese learning in a global context, integrating the learning of language skills and cultural traditions of both the 'traditional' and the 'diasporic' Cantonese communities. Students are encouraged to develop an understanding of the Cantonese speech communities and have comprehensive discussions on social and cultural affairs relating to the Cantonese communities. Comparison and translation between Cantonese and Mandarin is also part of the course content. As Cantonese shares a character writing system with Mandarin Chinese (Putonghua) and the majority of the Cantonese lexicon are identical or similar to the Mandarin equivalents, the focus of this course is on the acquisition of more advanced lexical items and syntactical structures that are unique in Cantonese, including Cantonese proverbs, sayings and idioms.

Environmental controversies, inequality within and between nations, and changing population dynamics typify these challenges. Students explore how policy processes in such contexts are far from regularized or systematic. When familiar economic, political, administrative and communicative processes are under extreme pressure or break down entirely, policy-makers are often dealing with what are referred to as \u2018wicked problems\u2019, for which there are no clear policy solutions, and few examples of successful policy on which to draw.

Thrown work is decorated by working into and onto the surface of the clay using carving, incision, underglaze, oxides and glaze. Practical workings with clay are underscored by lessons on kiln loading and firing. There are weekly lectures which incorporate examples of artists who work with clay on the wheel across both traditional and experimental techniques. There is an emphasis on experimenting with materials, surfaces and form and on considering the politics and poetics of material origins and transformations that are inherent in ceramic practices.",

        "In this course, students will investigate a range of approaches to working with and thinking about clay. Students will explore multiple ceramics methods including construction, surface treatment and decoration, as well as the processes and technologies concerned. Students will also be encouraged to consider the material of clay in relation to contemporary conceptual concerns and other art modalities. Through project-based explorations, students will create a unique body of work with a focus on developing a research framework, whilst also developing skills and knowledge of clay and ceramics in relation to the transformation of three dimensional ideas. Self-direction is emphasized in the development of skills that investigate, ideate and execute solutions. Students are expected to evidence substantial research, sophistication of design ideas and planning.",

        "Peoples now regarded as `Indigenous\u2019 have existed since time immemorial but the category itself has a relatively short history. This course examines the category from a number of angles, starting with its emergence during the 1980s, when the concept of Indigeneity was first raised in the United Nations. Students will draw out the assumptions and challenges of collective, internationally-authored, `Indigenous\u2019 socio-political identities by engaging with global discourses about and by\u00a0Indigenous\u00a0peoples and well as with their politico-legal contexts.\u00a0Particular attention will be paid to the\u00a0role of settler-colonies in the presence of formulations of Indigeneity, and the ambiguities of the concept in many Asian, East and South Asian, as well as African countries. The course will explore the\u00a0complexities of and issues with the idea of Indigeneity in different parts of the globe \u2013 its acceptance, rejection, or embrace \u2013 drawing on ethnographic literature from acros the planet.",

It engages with\u00a0First Nations scholarship from across the globe and considers the development of\u00a0Indigenous\u00a0research methodologies and approaches. The course asks how this global scholarship informs localised approaches to a range of issues, including issues of boundaries,\u00a0Indigenous diasporas,\u00a0Indigenous\u00a0ecological knowledge and conservation, the rise of recognition of\u00a0Indigenous\u00a0knowledges in new domains, and\u00a0Indigenous\u00a0storytelling in the arts\u00a0and other media.",

Students will work through a number of case studies and discuss what has happened in various cases, the extent to which the category `Indigenous\u2019 is mobilised by particular groups, consider what the future of this category of `Indigeneity\u2019 may be, and the roles Indigeneity may play in planetary futures."

This course will critically assess the theoretical and conceptual debates surrounding China\u2019s rise, as well as the ways in which China\u2019s historical legacy has shaped its worldview, foreign policy and evolving global engagement. Particular attention will be given to four main areas: (1) key theoretical and conceptual approaches to interpret China\u2019s rise, as well as the connections between China\u2019s history and contemporary debates on its foreign policy; (2) the main drivers of China\u2019s global engagement; (3) China\u2019s evolving relations around the world; (4) and the processes of competition, contestation and cooperation in key areas of global governance.

As such, this course will train the student to make judgements about (i) which areas of PRC-US relations to prioritise and to develop their own analytical frameworks for prioritisation; (ii) to develop an understanding of how countries in the region are responding to PRC-US competition; and (iii) to develop analytical and policy tools to adapt those dynamics.",

        "Internal armed conflicts, violent contests of power within sovereign states, have emerged as the deadliest form of political violence in Asia. Over the past seven decades, more than a million people have been killed and countless others displaced as a result of civil wars, mass killings, ethnic riots and terror attacks across the region. Apart from the tragic loss of human lives, these conflicts have and continue to impede economic and political development of the nation states they seek to contest. This course examines the major ideological, economic and sociological drivers of internal armed conflicts in Asia. We will review influential theories from political science and sociology that explain the onset, conduct and termination of armed conflict and will assess how they apply to past and ongoing conflicts in Asia. The course will pay special attention to empirical issues in the study of political violence and the challenges of collecting data in information poor environments. We will also look at the success and failures of peace-making efforts and the precarious process of post-conflict recovery."

Hamiltonian mechanics is also introduced, as are the tensor properties of materials. The course examines wave phenomena in continuous media, including diffraction and Fourier theory, and continuum mechanics in fluids. The course material is supported throughout by examples taken from recent research on mechanical systems, nano-optics, atomic physics, biological systems, fluid mechanics and laser physics. Computer models provide an opportunity to explore various concepts presented in lectures, including coupled linear oscillators and chaotic dynamics in driven non-linear oscillators. Complementing the lectures, this course contains a laboratory component. Some experiments are essentially qualitative and support lecture material, while others allow development of important skills in quantitative experimental physics.

        "This course examines the climate change problem in terms of vulnerability and adaptation from scientific, societal and policy perspectives. There is now a certain amount of unavoidable climate change, and therefore there a need to adapt to these changing climatic conditions and their consequences. The need to adapt and the kinds of adaptation responses necessary will depend on how the climate changes at a specific location over time, whether the direct or indirect impacts are positive or negative, and the capacity of people and systems to respond. In considering climate change vulnerability and adaptation as a field of study we focus on key theories (conceptual frameworks), methods and sources of information. Key concepts include the IPCC assessment framework, risk, 'co-benefit' and 'no-regret' policy responses, adaptation evaluation criteria, and adaptation policies. Analytical methods covered in the course include climate change scenario analysis and conceptual modelling. Learning approaches include lectures, a field trip, workshop discussions and group work, and practical data analysis exercises. These are assessed in written assignments, including a major report analysing the climate change adaptation policy of a nation. Most course material is available online to enrolled students. Practical exercises will be conducted in a hybrid model."

It departs from dominant approaches that treat climate change as a distinct national or militarised security issue and one that can be treated as a separate 'issue area' from the work involved in peacebuilding, disaster management, and economic post-crisis recovery. The course aims to generate knowledge of contemporary and historical debates regarding the interdependence of the environment and the drivers of conflict and instability. A wide array of evidence and case studies from the most crisis-affected regions especially Asia and the Pacific will be employed to make visible how conflicts, disasters and humanitarian emergencies are occurring in ways that challenge prevailing models of peacebuilding and sustainable development. Bringing in diverse and multiple perspectives to peace, this course seeks to present how and why climate change \u2013 along with its various causes and consequences \u2013 is the defining issue for transforming global politics. Crucially, this course invites students to rethink global peace and security in terms of people and planet."

While catastrophic weather events such as fires, cyclones, and droughts increasingly tax state capacity, the political, economic and social consequences pose potentially grave risks for state stability and global order. This course examines climate change and environmental security from a national security lens, examining the potential for conflict, confrontation and cooperation. Students will closely examine the securitisation and politicisation of climate change issues, the flow on effects for national security, and policy options for adaptation. Scholars and policy practitioners from NSC, the Crawford School and the wider policy community will provide deep insights into the science, economics and policy of climate change and environmental security. \u00a0Throughout, this course examines the challenges faced by scientists, security scholars, and practitioners to influence policy in the post-truth age."

This course aims to assess the different forms that coercion can take and how effective these national security strategies are likely to be under different contexts. It is designed to help students understand the roles and effects of different strategies of coercion such that they can be better consumers and producers of these strategies. The course will also explore what historical cases of coercion teach us about the present, and use an interactive all of class wargame to further illustrate the strategic elements of coercion. Students will explore the challenges of estimating the effectiveness of coercion from theoretical and policy-making practitioner perspectives."

By bringing together extractive colonial and settler colonial cases we aim to identify similarities and differences in the experience of colonialism and the rule of law, and query both the idea of the rule of law as preeminent political ideal for our time as well as contrariwise positions that treat it as nothing other than a fig leaf for colonial domination and oppression. Importantly, we will also look at the continuing legacy of colonial legal and political histories, and the relationship of the rule of law to political and social crises in our time.",

        "The rule of law is a specific historical development of global significance, and one that is inextricable from colonial histories and postcolonial conditions. Proponents throughout the world, including Australia and the Asia-Pacific, point to it as a solution to an array of problems. Critics for their part lambast it as neocolonial and exploitative. In this course, we cover the ground between these poles by turning to the rule of law in its particulars, through study of its relationship to colonialism and post-colonialism in Asia, Australia and beyond. By bringing together extractive colonial and settler colonial cases we aim to identify similarities and differences in the experience of colonialism and the rule of law, and query both the idea of the rule of law as preeminent political ideal for our time as well as contrariwise positions that treat it as nothing other than a fig leaf for colonial domination and oppression. Importantly, we will also look at the continuing legacy of colonial legal and political histories, and the relationship of the rule of law to political and social crises in our time.",

The course is deliberately interdisciplinary in its contents, modes of instruction and methods. It draws on a rich comparative socio-legal, anthropological, sociological and political scientific literature that in recent years has delivered an impressive range of studies on the rule of law in different colonial times and places, and work that ties the empirical contents of the course to overarching concepts of legality, authority and power."

It emphasises the plurality of colonial experiments and experiences across the continent, and critically considers the ways in which they were shaped by distinctive histories of encounter, foundation, geography, and connectedness to places, including other colonies, beyond Australia. Indigenous perspectives will also be highlighted. While the course will canvass some conventional major themes in nineteenth-century Australia such as convicts, frontiers, and gender relations, it will do so by focusing on unconventional, marginal, and unfamiliar places, people, episodes, institutions, and practices. Students will be given opportunities to work with and interpret the detritus of colonial Australia, including objects, images, and ruins. In addition, some attention will be given to the ways in which \"history-making\" in diverse forms - e.g. writing, commemorating, reenacting, painting -- accompanied colonial occupation, and how the historical mythologies produced have since been challenged, making way for new perspectives and voices in Australian history. This will allow for a dialogue between colonial and postcolonial histories and perspectives."

Common law reasoning is, in many ways, more fundamental than statutory interpretation. In contrast to the civil law legal system, we call our system a common law legal system. Common law reasoning is foundational to our legal system. Besides a common law approach to case law, we also speak of a common law approach to constitutional interpretation and a common law approach to statutory interpretation. Common law reasoning permeates all areas of law in our legal system.

        "This course is a practical, hands-on master class which will help students to design, critique and implement a community development strategy. Different types of community development strategies will be examined, such as Asset Based Community Development, Feminist Participatory Action Research, Participatory Rural Appraisal and a Freirean approach. These strategies will be compared and contrasted. The course will examine the theory behind each approach, but will especially focus on the practical implementation of each strategy. Students will have an opportunity to practice these techniques and provide feedback on demonstrations of these techniques. This course will also provide a contextual understanding of how non-governmental agencies, community associations and local government agencies operate in an array of contexts, both in Australia and in Asia and the Pacific. At the end of this course, students should feel confident to develop their own community development strategy and employ a range of techniques, particularly in complex scenarios."

How can effective resistance create desirable change? Drawing from political theory, sociology, criminology and social psychology, students will be introduced to a range of lenses and frameworks to understand individual and collective obedience and disobedience.

In part brought about by geopolitical developments, a major and continuing realignment of international exhibition rationales has seen the work of a number of Asian artists featured regularly in major biennial and triennial exhibitions around the world.

        "This course examines in detail a range of contemporary issues that present challenges for diplomatic practitioners and which appear to demand innovative diplomatic responses. There are an increasing number of global and regional issues which can only be managed through diplomatic processes, not through the use of force. But how best to manage these issues is exceptionally challenging. For example, the increase in violent international terrorism is putting the debate about whether diplomacy is a necessary but not sufficient management under the spotlight. Moreover, there are other types of challenges that are the result of new methods of practicing diplomacy, such as digital diplomacy and network diplomacy. Into the mix, the increasing networks of state-based diplomats and non-state actors, raise questions about the exact nature of diplomatic challenges from the perspective of the different players.These challenges raise practical and intellectual questions. For example, in a globalising and interdependent world exactly what comprises states\u2019 interests and who decides \u2013 how do the representatives of the state, the state-based diplomats, attempt to reconcile their state\u2019s national interests around issues that require collective action. What does sovereignty mean today and how do state-based diplomats and non-state actors frame and negotiate sovereignty? How are global and regional multilateral institutions and regimes negotiated and in whose interests and values? Is international law or politics the structure that directs diplomatic agency and practice? Does the analysis of diplomatic practices concerned with contemporary diplomatic challenges provide generalisations that inform a theory of practice?"

The emphasis is less about being entitled to be a leader and more about how participants can become leaders that they themselves would like to be. This is a challenging question and gets to the heart of one's major life decisions.

        "There are a variety of reasons for wanting to measure the costs and benefits from policy and other changes in economic activity. Governments want to measure the impact of their policy changes on society as a whole, while private agents focus on the impact they have on their own welfare and the welfare of those they care about. In markets subject to tax and other distortions market prices are not normally reliable measures of the social valuation of goods and services. Thus, they cannot be used to evaluate the social impact of policy and other changes. Instead, we derive shadow prices of goods and services to look through market distortions and measure social valuations. When changes in economic activity are evaluated using these shadow prices they provide measures of the social impact of policy and other changes. This course summarises the information provided by different welfare measures for single consumers and then looks at ways to aggregate them over consumers. In doing so, we examine ways to account for distributional effects in policy evaluation. Tax reform and the optimal provision of public goods are examined as applications of these shadow pricing rules."

We examine significant events, including shared histories, drawn from across the Australian continent. We consider the philosophical frameworks of First Peoples' ways of knowing, and reflect on how these have informed, and continue to inform, First Peoples' ways of being, knowing and acting today.\u00a0We explore basic precepts borne of a Country-centred way of being, including relationality and respect for autonomy. Students have an opportunity to develop insight into the significance of kinship, language, place, and their continuities. We explore examples of complex social systems, and consider contemporary relationships in Australia in the context of global developments in First Peoples\u2019 relationships, identity and shared/common experiences.\u00a0\u00a0The course creates a space for a learning experience that offers opportunities to develop insight into First Peoples\u2019 perspectives on colonisation in Australia.",

Over this period the problem of crime and efforts to devise effective means of delivering justice posed an ongoing challenge for legislators, philosophers, religious leaders, scientific experts, and institutional managers.What counts as crime? How should crime be controlled? Does mercy have a place in punishment? Is the state an agent of injustice? Debate over these questions led to new institutions, practices, and concepts, including: the invention of the penitentiary; the abolition of capital punishment; and the rise of eugenics.Lectures and readings will focus on key dilemmas that brought crime and justice into question. Tutorials will involve the analysis of original documents and the essay will explore an historical crime and justice dilemma in depth."

We consider key questions that frame stages of research, from identifying who we are in the research process (positionality) and the plethora of sources we can use to build our research programs, to the groups we wish to learn from and the most contextually appropriate methods we should adopt in collecting data. We engage with key texts and methodologies relating to Pacific research, including Talanoa (typically associated with Fiji, Samoa and Tonga), Kaupapa Maori (research by Maori, for Maori and with Maori), the Tivaevae model (from Cook Islands) and emergent Melanesian research methodologies. In parallel, the course will consider strategies to strengthen inclusivity in both the methods and content of research in the Pacific, to ensure the voices of women, people with disability, the politically marginalised and those living in remote communities are heard. Throughout the course, we will discuss how indigenous paradigms relate to inclusive research, western research models, and university systems."

        "The essential importance of intangible heritage as a core part of human understanding is being increasingly recognised both nationally and internationally. In 2003 UNESCO passed the Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Heritage and in so doing explicitly acknowledged the value of forms of cultural knowledge such as performance, song, storytelling and dance, and the practices that underpin tangible artistic outcomes. This course surveys key conventions and associated operational guidelines alongside questions of cultural politics, human rights, ownership and copyright. It explores the role of the museum and digital technology in safeguarding and curating intangible heritage. It also frames intangible heritage as a valuable concept for rethinking heritage as a cultural process in which the relationship between the tangible and intangible are renegotiated. Students are asked to consider intangible heritage in relation to key concepts including affect, identity, performativity, temporality, place, and memory. In so doing they will develop a sophisticated and well-informed approach to heritage work which considers the intangible alongside the material. In addition to Heritage and Museum Studies, this course may be of interest to student in history, anthropology, digital humanities and the performing arts."

The course is concerned with considering the issues and problems of managing in cross-cultural situations, in particular at the people problems that invariably arise in international business relationships. Failure on the part of managers to understand and deal with the difference in attitudes, values and behaviour of those with whom they interact in business transactions consistently has been shown to be a major source of difficulties. The course will involve marrying theories and concepts from the broad fields of culture and international business and applying them to problems typically confronted by managers involved in international business.

As the law in this area is emerging, and because there is not always an established scholarship on the current legal problems, the course draws on the expertise and experience of practitioners, developers, and regulators as well as academics.

        "This course has two goals: first, to explore the importance of creative practices as ways of knowing in Asian and Pacific cultures, and second, to advance creative practices as part of innovative research on Asia and the Pacific. We will look closely at diverse cultural forms, which may include performance traditions, rituals, oral stories, print culture, and/or visual and digital media, to investigate how they work as modes of historical knowledge, cultural critique, and political reflection. In dialogue with these forms, we will consider how your own academic research might expand beyond traditional scholarly boundaries by working more intimately with creative expression. Experimenting with forms that may include ethnography, life writing, embodied practice, fiction, visual art, and/or multimedia, we will consider how different ways of representing place, person, voice, the self, history, and the integration of creative practice and critical theory can lead to new and expanded ways of engaging with Asian and Pacific societies."

Students will explore the dynamics of social relations of Indonesia within its \u2018Island Southeast Asia\u2019 region allowing for some comparative analysis. Students will develop skills essential for careers in policy analysis, government, education, the development sector, cultural institutions, media, and technology. The course also advocates for knowing Indonesia not only because it is the largest Muslim majority country and 'strategically important', but because it will open doors to a more resilient, invigorating and intellectually stimulating world. Many of our graduates testify that these qualities of Indonesia are crucial for their ongoing engagement with the country beyond university study. Because of this, we utilize case studies of Indonesian anthropology, literature, social media creatives, Islamic \u2018industries\u2019, indigenous philosophies, art, music and performance."

Each of the disciplines shares a core concern with cultural identity, difference and change across time and space, in both material and nonmaterial worlds. They deploy a wide range of theoretical frameworks and methodologies (fieldwork, lab work, data analysis) that in many ways bridge the divide between the humanities, the social sciences and the physical sciences. In introducing students to ways in which the three disciplines approach Nature and Culture, the course will build on the two overarching themes of Body and Environment. Within these, students will investigate key topics  and case studies around bipedality, foodways, totemism, migration, archaeological tourism and more. Although materials and methods differ between disciplines, the challenge of the Anthropocene makes it more critical than ever to understand the past, present and future of our societies, and what it is that makes us human.

        "The remarkable economic emergence of Asia in recent decades has transformed many impoverished and largely agriculturally based societies into the most dynamic region of the contemporary world. Asia\u2019s burgeoning aspirational middle classes, rapid urbanisation, the expansion of participatory democracy and the shift from command economies to de-regulated markets have had profound effects on people\u2019s everyday lives and the diverse cultural practices that have long shaped local livelihoods and community expectations. This course offers an introduction into anthropological approaches to the study of culture, modernity and globalisation in Asia. Relevant themes that have attracted anthropological interest include changing traditions and popular culture, adaptive custom and cosmopolitanism, migration and citizenship, identity politics and social movements as well as distinctive and emergent forms of governance in both collective and self-cultivating forms of expression. Drawing on a rich corpus of social theory and ethnographic research from anthropologists past and present, the course will provide students with conceptual and analytical tools to appreciate adaptive cultural practices in comparative terms, to review and appreciate the key anthropological debates and influential works in the study of modernity, and to introduce students to ethnographic approaches for researching and writing on modernity and contemporary ethnographies of global connection."

        "Although the ideas of cyber warfare and of computer network attacks are new, there is growing awareness of the significant issues they raise in the modern world. The Australian Government is not alone in acknowledging the threat of cyber attacks and the need to develop cyber security capability. There is a strong interest, particularly among Canberra communities, in anticipating potential legal issues that might arise in cyber warfare and the applicability of existing rules of international law in this context.",

It considers the interaction of state and non-state actors, cyber enabled conflict and cooperation, as well as cyber-enhanced tools of statecraft including espionage and information operations. It also considers how states are adapting to the threats and opportunities in this new domain, including those presented by emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), drones and artificial intelligence. Throughout, it explores the future of cyberspace and emerging technologies and the potential to disrupt ideas of national security.",
        "Incorporating insights from scholars and practitioners at the ANU Cyber Institute as well as the wider academic and policy communities, this course draws from security studies, comparative politics, international law, psychology, and computer science. The focus of readings, lectures, and assessments will be more strategic than technical, though there will be coverage of the necessary technical vocabulary with which national security scholars and practitioners must be conversant. Throughout, global case studies are utilised to help illuminate different conceptual and theoretical perspectives, with an eye towards responsive security policy formulation."

        "This course centres the work of Indigenous scholars, from this continent and internationally, regarding research in general and research that concerns Indigenous peoples in particular. Decentring dominant paradigms of research methodologies and theoretical perspectives, this scholarship disrupts perspectives on Indigenous peoples, knowledge and ways of knowing. It critically challenges problematic \u2018truths\u2019 and other powerful ideas that have contributed to the dispossession and marginalisation of First Nations' Peoples. In challenging enculturated perspectives, positions and framing of knowledge, this course explores the possibilities of decolonising research, recognises the relevance of Indigenous perspectives in every sphere of knowledge and practice, and looks to the possibility of bringing First Peoples' ways of knowing into the academy. Repudiating deficit accounts of First Peoples, students are encouraged to reflect on more respectful and ethical engagement with (and between) Indigenous peoples, knowledge and ways of knowing, and to explore and innovate research premised on strength-based perspectives that recognise the resilience, capability, self- determination and resurgence of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples."

Monarchy was a dominant form of government: there were great empires ruled by kings and queens, from Assyria and Pharaonic Egypt to the territories conquered by Alexander the Great and the Romans, as well as smaller states and territories ruled by Greek tyrants, Bosphoran kings, or Persian satraps. But this period also witnessed the rise of different forms of government that challenged the monarchical paradigm in different ways, such as Greek oligarchy, Athenian democracy, and the Roman republic. This course will explore how these different systems of government emerged, interacted with each other, disappeared, and transformed into other constitutional forms, as well as the ways in which they have shaped modern political systems. It will be of interest to students studying History, European Studies, Politics, Philosophy, and Classical Studies, and many other areas."

Within the generic policy solutions that can provide starting points for crafting specific policy alternatives, the skills required range from structuring problems and solutions, measuring costs and benefits, anticipating and influencing political and organisational feasibility, and designing programs with good prospects for successful implementation. The subject will draw largely on the knowledge bases of management, politics and economics, and will identify practical tools for applied problems solving."

        "Digital technologies have infiltrated nearly all aspects of our existence, covering each natural and cultural urge from ordering food, checking our banking details, finding a partner, or paying our taxes. Our interactions with new digital and computational technologies affect how we think of ourselves and our cultural heritage, both individually and collectively; they influence the ways in which we interact socially and politically; and, they affect how we determine public and private spaces in an increasingly connected world. Our digital legacies even outlast our lives, preserving some part of us even once we are gone. Regardless of the level of involvement, we are all living in the digital era.\u00a0This course engages the students to discuss some of the key ways in which the digital has affected our lives, and what it really means. We examine different manifestations of human culture as it occurs online, pulling in examples from social media, the cultural heritage sector, even the Dark Web. We examine the ethical implications for collecting data about people, critique the ways in which information is presented and retrieved online, discuss popular trends and online behaviours, and tackle questions related to some of the less pleasant aspects of online culture. In order to do so, we need a thoughtful, ethical, critical, and interdisciplinary approach to the study and development of technology. Technology should be understood together with, and in the context of, understanding humanity. Understanding the technology alone is not enough, we need to understand how technology and humanity interact.",

        "Natural disasters and epidemics present risks on a new scale for the Asia-Pacific region, which has been characterised by dramatic increases in population density and in economic growth. More recent events need to be understood in the context of the region's long history of cataclysmic disasters, including earthquakes, tsunamis, cyclones, volcanic eruptions, flood and drought, and a sequence of devastating epidemics, from the Plague through to avian flu. This course addresses the social, cultural and economic dimensions of the history of disasters and epidemics in Asia and the Pacific, the role of these events in shaping societies in the region, and the recent transformations in the scale of their impacts and the nature of trans-national, state and community responses. Case studies of particular disasters and epidemics address questions of their causes and consequences, and will be grounded through guest lectures in an understanding of the science of disasters. The scope for reducing future impacts is considered within the framework of both state and community-based strategies for the promotion of resilience and Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR), the unequal distribution of risk, risk assessment and insurance, and the additional contribution of global climate change."

        "Disasters and their aftermaths can expose physical areas, social processes, and mental worlds that we tend not to see in day-to-day life. This course examines how disasters in the modern world are historicised, memorialised and remembered, and how these processes have influenced understandings of risk, vulnerability, and social and environmental justice. Working across diverse case studies, including nuclear tests, political unrest, and industrial disease, this course considers a diverse range of historical evidence to assess the ways in which understandings of disaster have been shaped and contested through collective memory and memorialisation. Through an examination of museum exhibitions, government inquiries and policies, public ceremony and commemoration, popular culture, and risk assessments, we will examine how the memory and representation of disasters have been debated and transformed. As extreme weather events become more frequent and intense with questions of accountability, mitigation, and adaptation, this course will encourage reflection on the contested meanings of 'disaster' in framing what and who is remembered, and the legacies that are forged in their aftermath."

        "Contemporary societies comprise of diverse populations. Diversity can be the result of not only internal dimensions (such as ethnicity, gender, and age) but also different historical, social, and institutional processes with each population encountering unique risks and needs. One of the most consistent finding in criminology is that minority populations are over-represented at all stages of the criminal justice process both as victims and offenders. Hence, one of the critical issues in criminology today is addressing inequality within the criminal justice system and how to best cater to the needs of such diversity. In this course, students will be introduced to theoretical understanding of marginalisation and inequalities within the criminal justice system. Students will explore current responses to diverse populations and examine ways to reduce inequality within the criminal justice system.Diversity and Crime is a capstone unit for the Bachelor of Criminology."

        "Mantle convection is the fundamental agent driving many of the geological features observed at Earth's surface, including plate tectonics and volcanism. However, many geologists have an incomplete understanding of the process, whilst there are many misconceptions about how it relates to surface processes. A broad background to the physics and fluid dynamics of mantle convection will be provided in this course, by explaining what it is, how it works, and how to quantify it in simple terms. It assumes no specialist background: mechanisms will be explained simply and the required basic physics will be fully reviewed and explained. The distinctive forms that convection takes within Earth's mantle will be described within the context of tectonic plates and mantle plumes, whilst the implications for geochemistry and Earth's tectonic evolution will be explored. Common misconceptions and controversies will be addressed, providing a straightforward, but rigorous, explanation of this key process. Emerging insights into the fundamental links between climate, surface processes (weathering, erosion and sediment transport), plate tectonics and underlying mantle flow will also be covered, thus providing a complete overview of Earth\u2019s dynamic engine."

What theories of value can illuminate these practices without reducing them to variants of Eurocentric models of exchange, production, consumption and distribution? How might such an expanded sense of economic life reframe the way we understand contemporary arrangements of money, markets, and financial systems in ways do not take their inevitability for granted? This course introduces students to foundational theories and key anthropological cases of human cultural economies. We explore classic ethnography of non-capitalist exchange systems as well as anthropological approaches to exotic financial arrangements spanning crypto to fintech to hedge funds. Through a series of applied projects, the course develops key skills for students to do economic anthropology themselves."

The approach is to present state-of-art economic development theories and models, investigate their empirical validity and the underlying pre-requisite conditions, and draw out the implications for institutional and policy designs. Major issues related to economic development and sustainability are discussed and illustrated using the experiences and lessons of selected countries and regions. Relevant economic theories and models are employed to explain these issues and to inform policy making, followed by a thorough discussion of existing case studies from around the world. Students will gain experience using modern statistical tools to analyse development issues and policy responses in developing economies."

Participants will examine the efficiency of resource allocation in the economy as a whole and at the micro level in decision making by individuals, firms and government actors.

Focussing on class, gender, and race/ethnicity - as well as their intersectionality - students will develop a critical awareness of 'who does what' in the global economy, why some forms of work (whether paid or unpaid) are valued more than others, and how material deprivation and social disadvantage are mutually reproduced. We will consider key issues relating to the transition from industrial to post-industrial societies in the Global North, while working to de-centre Eurocentric perspectives by resituating key debates in Global South contexts where the majority of the world live and work."

        "Since early Twentieth century, Egypt has been home to many of the Middle East most significant social, political and ideological movements. Egypt\u2019s Gamal Abdel Nasser\u2019s leadership of the non-aligned movement as well as his pan-Arabist ideology has brought Egyptian politics and foreign policy to world attention. The recent Arab uprisings and their aftermath have again brought to the fore the importance of Egyptian internal politics and their ramifications regionally and globally. An understanding of the society and politics of Egypt is essential to contextualising the recent events. The course will examine Egypt\u2019s complex history with authoritarianism, populism, civil society activism, informal politics and the interplay between economic development and political trends."

It ranges from exploring the legal principles that govern running elections in Australia through to contemplating the ways in which democracy is under threat in a modern era.",
        "The course will consider a range of different aspects of public law in practice. For example: the constitutional and legislative backdrop to the entitlement to vote, qualification to run for parliament and political communication, the administrative law principles at play in party registration and redistribution processes and the regulatory enforcement of money in politics. The position, influence and oversight of other players in our electoral and political system will also be examined, such as the courts, people (including through referenda), ministers and their advisors. There will also be the option to consider contemporary pressures (misinformation/disinformation, foreign interference and social media) and draw on comparative perspectives.",
        "In the first part of the course, we will focus on the theories, actors, and historical and contemporary tensions that underpin the study, practice and coherence of electoral law in Australia with a particular focus on representative democracy and equality of participation. This will include considering the development of 'the Australian ballot', exploring the system of representative and responsible government including the make-up of the legislatures and systems of voting across Australia and contemporary tensions about the roles of non-elected officials such as Ministerial advisors.\u00a0\u00a0We then move to develop and apply our understanding of substantive electoral law as well as proposals for legislative reform. Examples of these areas include: qualification of members and Senators, the implied right to vote, the implied freedom of political communication, regulating political communication, donations, party registrations, redistributions and the role of Courts in elections."

This was the world which witnessed the foundation of the city of the Constantinople in the fourth century AD and its gradual establishment as the capital of the eastern Roman empire, surviving the disintegration of the west. This period also saw the emergence of Christianity as a state religion, prompting major new ecclesiastical building projects, the rise of charismatic religious figures and the development of the medieval cult of relics. The Byzantine empire engaged actively with its neighbours to the West in Europe including the Carolingians and the papacy, and with Persia and the Islamic Caliphate to the East, with our sources revealing intricate diplomatic negotiations and fierce military engagements. And, in 1204 the Crusader sack of Constantinople sent shockwaves across the Christian world, changing forever relations between Byzantium and the West. This course will investigate Byzantine history through the activities of emperors and empresses, the roles of holy men and women, the spectacular art and architecture of the era, and the accounts of the ultimate fall of Constantinople, after a millennium of Byzantine rule, to the Ottomans in 1453."

        "The modern world is a product of centuries of conflict, rivalry and strategic cooperation between empires seeking to expand or protect their power across domains spanning from economic systems to religion and culture. Throughout Europe and the Mediterranean, Asia, the Americas, Africa, and the Pacific, the past 2000 years have seen radical historical transformations as empires rose, sought to create and sustain the conditions of their dominance, and fell. Understanding these dynamics has also been among the most innovative areas of historical inquiry. This course explores these processes and how historians have interpreted their significance and legacies, from the Roman Empire to the present. It places the complex and always contested \u2018rise of the West\u2019 in a global frame by investigating a range of topics from early Medieval kingdoms, the Spanish conquest of the Americas and the colonisation of India, Australia and New Zealand, to the Cold War. In doing so, it explores the technologies that enabled imperial growth, the ideologies that legitimated it, the resistance of many who fought against it, and associated movements of populations and international relations. Through a diversity of historical perspectives, it examines the impact of imperial exchanges in transforming institutions, environments and modes of life."

        "The course examines energy security from the perspective of diverse states, and traces their divergent paths to achieve it, especially with regard to current challenges in energy transition. Throughout, students will engage in analysis of contemporary energy security challenges and the implications for national and international security. The focus of the readings, lectures, class conversations and projects will be more political, economic and strategic than technical in nature, though there may be a small technical component to each topic. The course will engage with practitioner perspectives alongside academic insights."

Potential benefits from energy development to national and commercial entities are enormous, but so are the challenges stemming from the expansion of global economy, international and intra-regional competition, and the internal political dynamics of the Caspian states. The region is at the crossroads: from its current volatile situation, it could evolve either as an area of crisis, or as a zone of stability. The dynamics of energy development will be crucial for determining the actual outcome.",

        "Nuclear systems have many beneficial uses, ranging from medical imaging and cancer treatment to environmental monitoring \u2013 but the benefits these systems offer come with risks. For some nuclear systems, these risks \u2013 if not managed effectively \u2013 can have far-reaching and enduring impacts on society and the environment. This course will introduce a wide range of nuclear technologies being used in industry, medical and defence settings today. Students will develop expertise in some of the foundational nuclear physics and engineering knowledge required to design, operate, maintain and decommission such systems. Students will also learn how to consider nuclear systems using techniques from systems theory to identify potential risks stemming from technological, sociocultural, regulatory, and environmental factors shaping -- and being shaped by -- nuclear systems, and will learn how to integrate this view into engineering- and science-informed professional practice via individual and group assessments. Nuclear reactors will be heavily emphasized in the curriculum because of their significant risk profile, but the principles and practices introduced in the course will be applicable for engineering practices applicable to a broad range of nuclear systems."

        "This course will provide students with the skills and knowledge to understand and explain the complex biogeochemical cycles that drive environmental systems and processes. The course will provide a foundation in modern environmental chemistry, exploring interactions between the hydrosphere, geosphere, atmosphere and biosphere. Students will apply this knowledge to land management decision making across a range of contexts, including agriculture, mining, contaminated land remediation, native vegetation systems, and urban design. The course includes laboratory and field-based components, giving students practical experience in environmental sampling and analysis. Building upon these foundational topics, the course will investigate the chemical behaviour of polluting compounds and explore their partitioning within the environment. Students will develop skills valued in an array of professions, including environmental sample collection and preservation, laboratory analysis techniques, field testing, and applying conceptual environmental models. Students will be able to draw on course materials that provide diverse gender, cultural, and geographical perspectives on these topics."

The potential for markets, taxes, and subsidies to address environmental problems is explored across pollution control, water, energy, and climate change, among other areas. Requirements and challenges associated with economic policy instruments are compared to those associated with traditional regulatory-based, or \u2018command and control\u2019, mechanisms for dealing with environmental issues. Key economic principles and techniques are applied to contemporary case studies throughout the course, including cost-benefit analysis of infrastructure projects and alternative approaches to managing urban water scarcity. This course will benefit policy-makers and other practitioners who seek to apply, analyse, and/or critique economic approaches to environmental policy, particularly those without previous formal training in economics or experience in applying it to real-world policy challenges."

The course will provide a foundational understanding of fluid statics and dynamics which respectively relate to pressure forces exerted by standing bodies of water (i.e. in dams and pipe networks) and the behaviour of moving fluids. This will extend into an exploration of boundary layer flows, an understanding of which is essential for predicting mass transport, shear forces, and heat transfer processes at fluid interfaces. Environmental topics such as rocks and soils will be introduced as well. Building on these foundational elements, students will investigate the application of fluid dynamics to environmental systems through the study of closed-channel (pipes and ducts) and open-channel (rivers and irrigation) flows, and flows in porous media, which is of relevance to the study of groundwater and drainage. The course will connect and discuss the interaction of these macro-scale fluid flows to global-scale fluid flows.

This Masters level seminar provides an in-depth exploration of the theoretical foundations and intellectual processes that shape anthropological thinking and writing, while also addressing longstanding themes and issues in anthropology within the contexts of colonialism, anti-imperialism, postcolonialism, and social activism. Rather than presenting a mere survey of the history of theory, this course aims to cultivate the ability to critically evaluate theoretical issues and develop an anthropological imagination, enabling students to explore ethnographic problems or issues through the lens of current and longstanding debates in social theory. It offers a unique opportunity for students to engage with cutting-edge ethnographic monographs that not only showcase the latest developments in the field but also exemplify the emergence of novel theoretical approaches rooted in ethnographic methods and writing. Weekly exercises will directly apply theoretical discussions to ethnographic cases.",

        "Evidence law governs the use of proof in legal proceedings and answers important questions like: How much proof is enough? What will the jury be allowed to hear? And what kinds of proof can be used? Evidence law is also a major component of trial procedure, governing how proof is presented in a trial. The law of evidence regulates the emergence of the parties\u2019 narratives; and decisions about evidentiary issues frequently determine which version of events is believed, what is considered \u2018fact\u2019 and what is not. Liberty, property, livelihoods and families can hang in the balance.",

Evidence law is the lens through which the legal system views the \u201cfacts\u201d of a case. Understanding how a record of evidence is developed will give you new insight into litigation processes and appellate decisions. It will also give you a new perspective on the adversarial system and the importance of advocacy. If you become a litigator or barrister someday, evidence law will be your bread and butter. If you never become a litigator, you will need to know evidence law in order to make appropriate decisions for clients who are not in litigation. Protecting your clients\u2019 rights outside litigation may depend on your knowledge about what might be admissible if litigation were eventually employed. Even if you leave law and go into business or another field, understanding evidence will give you a new perspective on the nightly news.",

A wide range of case studies will be used to illustrate the application of these principles, including conflict and cooperation, foraging and resource use, mating and parenting, life history and fertility, and the individual in society.

        "A conception of human nature plays a central role in many debates in philosophy, and in the humanities and social sciences more broadly. This course aims to introduce students to evolutionary theories of human nature. We will discuss such issues as (i) whether evolutionary theory undermines the very idea of a fairly fixed and universal human nature; (ii) how and why humans came to be so very different from their great ape relatives; (iii) whether the explanatory toolkit that suffices to explain animal evolution suffices to explain human evolution as well, or whether (for example) the importance of culture to humans changes the rules of the evolutionary game; (iv) the extent to which we can have reasonably reliable knowledge of the human past. Students will engage in interdisciplinary work, analysing and responding to research not just in philosophy but also in relevant empirical disciplines, including archaeology, prehistory, palaeoanthropology, and behavioural economics.\u00a0The course with not be considering the creation vs evolution controversy; the basic truth of an evolutionary theory of life will be assumed."

Themes covered in this course include: the interconnections between exploration and natural history including how 'specimens' collected by explorers influenced western scientific knowledge and taxonomy; the influence of technology and media on facilitating exploration and producing ever expanding audiences; and a critical evaluation of the idea of the 'lone explorer' by tracing how these travellers were self-fashioned, depicted in popular culture, and highlighting their often unacknowledged colleagues and intermediaries who assisted them."

        "The Greek and Roman gods are perhaps one of the best-known elements of Classical culture. And yet there is no ancient Greek word for religion. Can we speak, then, of \u2018faith\u2019 and \u2018belief\u2019 in a Greek and Roman context, or are these concepts misnomers when applied to pagan religion? This course not only teaches students about religious practice in the Greek, Roman and Byzantine worlds, but encourages deep reflections about what it means to \u2018believe in the god(s)\u2019 within and throughout the religious transformations that accompanied the historical period c. 800 BCE-600 CE. The development of new cults, the deification of kings and emperors, and the rise of monotheistic religions like Christianity all attest to the complex and shifting nature of the ancient religious landscape. Within this, was there room for religious dissent? How accommodating were official state religions to variety, change and localism? How do our concepts of \u2018agnostic\u2019 and \u2018atheist\u2019 map onto the lived religious experiences of ancient Greeks and Romans? Students of this course will learn about how the concepts of faith and belief in Classical antiquity intersected with other key elements of ancient society and culture including politics, art, architecture, science and philosophy."

This course examines how key sites of negative affect in today\u2019s culture\u2014illness, trauma and death\u2014shape our understanding of feeling as a collective event. By focusing on a range of contemporary texts ranging across memoir, fiction, poetry and film, and from children\u2019s media to reflections on old age, this course will explore how these texts conceive of negativity in ways that are exuberant, poignant, and audacious. Using critical insights and methodologies from affect theory, death studies, psychology and the medical humanities, we will investigate how negativity, often perceived as isolating or individualistic, can be a site for renewal, social connection, and increased self-knowledge. In so doing, we will ask questions like, what do these encounters with life\u2019s limits tell us about how we conceive of our own lives? How do contemporary texts respond to historical traditions, theories and attitudes towards negativity and negative affect? And, can literature help us see that feeling bad can show us what\u2019s good about living?"

While in tropical rainforests, they have evolved to deal with wet, often dark conditions where they rarely encounter other members of their own species. Finding suitable places to settle, grow and reproduce is a challenge. In both environments plants and animals have evolved special morphologies, physiologies and behaviours that influence the way they interact with other species, and that allow them deal with extreme conditions.",

We explore the ways that diverse organisms respond to conditions in their environment and acquire the resources they need to survive, grow and reproduce: their functional ecology. The course location varies among years, but regardless of location the same theoretical principles will be explored in the context of protected area management, conservation and climate change.",

Our aim is to give participants a chance to do real science and to embrace being a scientist.

        "Money laundering and terrorist financing, also referred to jointly as financial crime, have given rise to an extensive legal and regulatory regime across much of the developed world. Banks and other regulated businesses monitor and report their customers' activities to law enforcement agencies. Law enforcement agencies, in turn, sift through a myriad such reports to identify truly criminal behavior and benefit from an ever-expanding array of tools at their disposal to confiscate the proceeds of crime (or funds intended for terrorist use).",
        "Over the past decades, the anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML/CTF) regime has come to play an important yet controversial role in criminal justice and financial regulation alike. This role is particularly prominent because money laundering can involve the proceeds of any predicate offense, ranging from drug trafficking to cybercrime, which accounts for the increasingly central role of AML/CTF measures in criminal justice.",

It will familiarise students with modes of legal reasoning that are distinct to private law as well as with the different fora (courts, arbitral tribunals, mediation) where private law is interpreted and applied. The course will focus primarily on common law legal systems, while also incorporating comparative elements. This will enable students to understand the unique character of Australian private law as a common law system transplanted into a settler colonial context. This course will operate as a general introduction to private law and will prepare students to undertake further, more specialised study in the field."

The goal of this course is to provide students with the scientific principles and empirical evidence that underpin the modern understanding of anthropogenic climate change. We will develop a quantitative understanding of the fundamental physics (radiation and surface energy balance, dynamics) governing the Earth System. We will examine the synthesis of climate observations to discern current global trends and investigate past climates. In particular, we will analyse uncertainties in the current predictions and outline ways in which the scientific community is moving to refine these predictions. Key components of the course will be informed using insights from ongoing research within the ARC Centre of Excellence in Climate Extremes (CLEx).",

We will acknowledge the diversity of the responses to and changing understandings of Gallipoli, from the early days of the campaign till today, with a particular focus on the Turkish experiences. The students will gain familiarity and appreciation of various historiographical trends and social and cultural changes that inform contemporary debates about Gallipoli and war commemoration in general. The course is designed to build awareness of the transnational aspects of the remembrance of the campaign, drawing on mainly Turkish and Australian perspectives. There is both an emphasis on theoretical discussions about commemorative phenomena and a hands-on experience of attending, observing and creating commemorative activities through authentic assessments. The students will collaborate with their peers to address multiple stakeholder demands while designing a commemorative project."

Students will gain insights to women\u2019s varied roles in both the perpetration of violence, and in peace building across clans and kinship networks, communities and through nation-building. Students will also grapple with the relevance of de-centering gender analytically and instead examine gender as it intersects with race/ethnicity, citizenship, class, religion, and sexuality in the analysis of the distinct challenges for peace and security in South and Southeast Asia. Finally, the course explores the significance of global and regional security and human rights agendas in enabling the pursuit of justice for women in South and Southeast Asia."

This course sets out a series of frameworks with which to understand and act upon these issues, as well as examining arguments about the key actors in international ethics and analysing the logics of various responses to ethical problems.

The course outlines different conceptual approaches to the study of global security and introduces students to core terms and debates in security studies. A central focus is how these approaches are applied to issues such as great power competition, the prospects for cooperation under conditions of uncertainty about the future, and the balance between justice and order in addressing global security threats. The course also looks at the architecture of global security governance, including alliances, international organisations, international regimes and international law. The course also looks into contemporary global security challenges such as arms racing, environmental security, and the challenges presented by new technologies."

        "This course explores contemporary global governance in practice, using case studies about the work of Multilateral Development Banks, like the World Bank and other regional development banks. Organisations like the World Bank have the potential to set the agenda for international development assistance, and traditionally have done so. However, geo-political changes at the start of the \u201cAsian Century\u201d are now leading to new and competing sources of development knowledge and finance. In this context, we explore the ideas, tools and policies that are typically used by Multilateral Development Banks to guide their operations and exert influence, including: the Sustainable Development Goals; loans for infrastructure; country-level reform packages; mechanisms for securing global public goods like biodiversity; rising private sector engagements; safeguards and grievance mechanisms; and development indicators. We explore the power, efficacy and limitations of these global governance practices, revealing: (i) the social construction and political nature of global expertise; and (ii) how institutions like the World Bank are not monolithic, but are often subject to internal contestation and practical limitations, as they confront a wide variety of complex, real-world problems.

In the 21st century, humanity faces challenges stemming from climate change, pandemics, rising inequality, and great power rivalry, which cannot be understood or managed from the perspective of a single discipline. Domains that were previously kept relatively separate (such as economics, security, health and the environment) are colliding. Governance regimes are multiplying, fragmenting, and overlapping in a bid to grapple with these challenges. This course considers approaches to governance in the face of complexity and uncertainty. It covers issues such as: what theories and tools can we use to better understand complex problems and systems dynamics? What frameworks can we develop to better understand and manage risks, opportunities and resilience across domains? How does incremental and transformative change happen in complex systems and what leverage points exist for interventions? The course uses contemporary examples, including COVID-19, the pushback against globalisation, and US-China tech/trade competition."

        "Human migration is the most visible and controversial aspect of current-day globalisation. It has played a major role in building modern Australia for more than two centuries, and today between a quarter and a third of all Australians were born abroad. Immigration of this scale has profound implications for every aspect of Australian society. The challenge of regulating human migration, mobility and refugee movements has therefore become a core concern for researchers, policy makers and practitioners in international relations, public policy, and international development. This course provides an introduction to Australia\u2019s migration system for students interested in these areas of regulation and governance. Through a range of learning activities, students will: 1) learn what drives and shapes Australia's major migration flows; 2) study the impacts of these flows on Australia's population, economy, national identity, politics, public policy, and place in the world; and 3) examine how these flows and impacts are governed by a range of government, intergovernmental, and non-governmental organizations."

Many intrinsically reasonable statutory initiatives fail in operation through lack of 'administerability'.

We look at the challenges facing energy transitions in Australia, but also across the world, particularly China, India, and other countries. We will consider how political factors shape energy transitions. Finally, we will look ahead and discuss how the dynamics of energy transitions worldwide, and global competition in innovation and industrial performance, are changing.

From this problem statement, the students are responsible for developing a full set of requirements and key performance indicators to guide their proposed solution. Using a systems engineering framework and working with a high degree of autonomy, the students then proceed through a systems design process including conceptual design, sub-system requirements, and trade-off analyses. Finally, they develop and implement their engineered solution, and evaluate it against the agreed performance indicators. At the end of the project, clients take delivery\u2014and participate in the evaluation\u2014of their team's output.

        "Covid-19 highlighted just how critical 'health' is in local, national, regional and global security. This course assesses the political and security significance of not only infectious diseases and pandemics but a broader range of existential threats to health such as climate, water and food security. From the historical experiences with smallpox, plague and cholera, to contemporary challenges posed by other infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS and SARS or the Covid-19 pandemic, it is clear that pathogenic micro-organisms exercise a powerful influence over the security of people, societies and states. Yet infectious diseases are themselves increasingly influenced and moderated by climate change, agricultural intensification and the increasing fragile balance at the nexus of humans, animals, plants and their ecosystems \u2013The One Health concept. The course draws on a broader operational definition of One Health and argues that health and security \u2013 both broadly defined \u2013\u00a0are interdependent and therefore require policy responses that are by definition multi-agency and whole of society. The course explores the relationships between not only infectious disease and the state response but how the state and its people consider and account for broader existential threats as constructs of health and security. The aim of the course is to provide students with a stronger understanding of the scientific and political nature of these threats to health and security, why and how they might threaten national and global security strategy design and implementation, and the conceptual and empirical connections between them. Course activities and assessment tasks are designed to encourage critical engagement with this key policy challenge of our age. To this end, the course includes a comparative exercise on how nations respond to these broad yet critical threats to health and security and the insights of policy practitioners will be integrated with academic teaching."

The course begins by locating anthropology in its contemporary post-colonial context with an examination of critical perspectives on the history of the discipline, and explores the challenge of reading the past from the perspective of the present. It then moves from a consideration of the emergence of 'society' and'the social' as objects of study, outlines and assesses key aspects of functionalist, structural-functionalist, and structuralist approaches, explores the influence of Marxism and practice theory, examines key aspects of interpretive and symbolic anthropology, and ends with an examination of the implications of globalisation and the post-representational turn for the doing and writing of ethnography."

        "From ancient Greece to 20th century Australia, there has been a desire to understand our ancestors. This course explores major developments that have shaped archaeology as a discipline around the world. We will travel from the time of 'Antiquarians' in 16th century England, through discovery of ancient human bones in Africa and ruins of famous sites and vanished civilisations in America, Australia and Europe. This course will also explore tipping points in archaeological theory and assess how these have influenced current perspectives on the past. Tutorials will focus on the contribution of individuals to the practice and interpretation of archaeology."

Although Asian states have ratified a large number of international human rights conventions, the violation of human rights and unequal application of and access to the law are common across the region. Citizens and migrants face arbitrary detention, torture, disappearance and death at the hands of state, para-state, and other actors. \u00a0In this course, we will study the types of human rights prevalent in Asia today and ask what institutional, political and social structures allow for their persistence. We will ask what types of abuses occur despite the efforts of governments to eliminate them and what types are encouraged through government inaction, or tacit or explicit encouragement or abuse. Yet simultaneous to our study of rights violations, we will also study new the new strategies of redress that have emerged, including the growth of human rights organisations and transitional justice processes and the development of linkages between international and local organisations.

        "In recent years, 'human security' problems and issues have gained increasing attention on global and regional security agendas as essential priorities alongside more traditional or military (or 'national') security concerns. The traditional definition of security premised on military defence of a territory puts human security and social factors at the periphery. Advocates for a human security approach argue that to insist on a narrower state-centric security paradigm at the expense of human security would leave the concept of security bereft of any practical meaning in many real-world circumstances. What is human security, and what kinds of security issues, problems or conflicts can it be applied to? How do human security perspectives generate different approaches and policies to traditional security thinking? In what ways does a human security approach provide innovative perspectives to address sources of insecurity more holistically? This course will critically examine the human security concept and a range of key human security issues in the Asian region, including intra-state and ethnic conflict, post-conflict peace building, displaced persons and refugees, landmines and small arms, the protection of children in conflict, and poverty and human development."

Debate on the role of humanitarianism in world politics often vacillates between belief in its capacity to transform the international system and frustration and disillusionment with its perceived failure to do so. In examining the role of humanitarianism in world politics, this course seeks to disaggregate these debates, revealing key themes, trends and questions in the evolution of the concepts and practices of humanitarianism. Central amongst these are the themes of assistance and protection that are often viewed as at the very heart of humanitarianism, along with advocacy and evidence. In doing this, the course looks at the historical evolution and global diffusion of humanitarian concepts and practices, the concepts and practices of both international humanitarian assistance and humanitarian intervention, and finally the extent to which conceptions of humanitarian obligations have come to underpin state building projects."

Students learn the importance of going beyond project-specific assessments to consider cumulative impacts and how strategic assessments can help to manage these. The course considers the role of\u00a0public participation and science in decision-making, and how\u00a0political, social and economic dynamics intersect such decisions.\u00a0Students gain experience with assessing impacts across diverse domains such as biodiversity, livelihoods, institutions, social structures, equity, culture and quality of life. The course has a strong emphasis on case-based learning and students have opportunities to explore alternative evaluation and assessment approaches across a range of sectors and national jurisdictions."

        "This course examines the ways in which Indigenous people, in Australia and elsewhere, have assumed the right to tell their own histories of imperialism, colonialism and dispossession through diverse forms of memorialisation, performance, writing, art and other modes of\u00a0meaning-making. The creative labour of Indigenous intellectuals, artists, filmmakers, writers, and historians shapes contemporary public culture in Australia and other settler-colonial nations, such as Canada, southern Africa, New Zealand and in the Pacific. This course explores such creative labour, both in the past and present. We will examine the ways in which Indigenous people have engaged with and challenged imposed cultural and historical forms and practices in ways that have redefined concepts such as sovereignty, self and other, nation and place, and history and time. Students will gain experience working with archives, images, objects, performance, television, lyrics, film and digital forms of storytelling."

        "This course introduces cross-cultural comparative perspectives on indigenous medicines, healing and health in colonial and post-colonial contexts. Contemporary condition of indigenous medicines and healing practices in Australia, Hawaii, Africa, India, and Southeast Asian nations, for example, are intertwined with the history of European colonial racial and gendered objectification of \u201cnative\u201d bodies, their medicines and healing approaches. We will examine the relationship between medicine as a tool of empire and how indigenous medicines,\u00a0healthcare practices, and health have been constructed, regulated, and transformed by colonial and post-colonial science, medicine, and social policies. We will also explore how\u00a0indigenous conceptions of the body, health, and approaches to care\u00a0persist as distinctive from contemporary biomedical paradigm.\u00a0We will explore the effects of this distinction on indigenous medicines, healing practices, and health\u2014that today is also manifest in clinical settings worldwide as a cultural tension between the biomedical doctor and the indigenous patient. Part 1 of the course will focus on the relationship between colonial medicine and indigenous medicines. Part 2 will focus on indigenous forms of medicines and conception of health and healing. Part 3 will focus on the contemporary forms of indigenous medicines and the health of indigenous people in light of the re-emergence of molecular biology, genetic science and the rise of cultural competency paradigm in biomedicine. In the process,\u00a0students will gain a historical understanding of key concepts associated with the construction of indigenous medicines such as ethnomedicine, traditional, alternative, and medical pluralism vis-\u00e0-vis the idea of what is modern and the formation of modernity."

Court-related litigation is more familiar to both lawyers and non-lawyers alike, yet captures only a fraction of the activity towards resolving disputes that occurs before consensual arbitration. Much as there has been a focus in domestic law on 'alternative dispute resolution', so in our globalised economy there is a whole institutional architecture for resolving private commercial disputes with a transnational dimension. The availability of such trusted arbitration (and adjudication) forums is central to parties' confidence in contractual arrangements, and so to facilitating transnational commerce in general. The importance of international commercial arbitration to international commerce is a key theme throughout the course.",

It will also reflect on the composition, competency and competition among different major global forums for international commercial arbitration: who are arbitrators, where are they doing this, what trends can be discerned in the non-judicial but binding legal resolution of commercial disputes?",

Through a series of case studies of the region, students will develop the skills to analyse how the norms, practices and structures that underpin international affairs today have developed since the 19th century, and what role Asia and the Pacific region played in this process. The course prompts students to imagine alternative pathways and outcomes arising from specific historical moments. Examples of these key case studies include: Pattern of the adaptation of international law by China and Japan; alternatives to the Europe-centred world system; critical assessment of the idea of human rights; colonial participation in international organisations; the development of international anti-terrorist law; historical origins of the border disputes in Northeast Asia; and the development of refugee law, with its implications for the current refugee crisis in Asia and Australia."

        "The purpose of the course is to examine the far-reaching changes that have occurred since the nineteenth century to the body of law governing recourse to the use of force (jus ad bellum). In 1945 the United Nations Charter prohibited States from resolving their international disputes by the threat or use of force except, subject to certain conditions, in self-defence, and established a system of collective security whereby the Security Council would take action in the name of the international community to maintain or restore international peace and security.",
        "The Cold War obstructed the effective realisation of these provisions. As a result of Security Council paralysis and in order to protect perceived essential national interests, some States adopted expansive concepts of self-defence or other justifications for recourse to force of doubtful legality.",
        "The collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s led to a renewal of hopes that a system of collective security might function as originally intended. Those hopes have not been entirely fulfilled, but the concept of international peace and security has been expanded in the last few decades to embrace violations of human rights, denial of democracy, and urgent humanitarian needs, thus justifying collective action under Security Council mandates.",
        "The course will not revisit in any great detail the normative content of self-defence, both individual and collective (in this regard students are encouraged to revise theirLAWS8183Advanced Principles of International Law materials), but will examine other contentious or sometimes overlooked issues: such as implied authorisations and intervention by invitation.

        "The Asia-Pacific region is changing rapidly as result of economic development, political change, and shifting international alignments. In many ways, it is the most dynamic region in the world. In this context, it is not enough for policy makers and policy advocates to understand where the region stands today. It is also vital for us to think deeply and systematically about where the region is headed tomorrow - whether the question is economic growth, environmental quality, or military conflict - even as we recognize that our ability to predict the future is limited.This course will equip students to grapple with the challenge of making policy in a rapidly changing region by introducing them to a few key tools. It will introduce students to the study of international relations, focusing on a select number of trends that are recognized as particularly important drivers of international change. In addition, it will introduce students to the concept and practice of scenario development, a technique used widely in both the private and the public sector as a means of thinking about and preparing for the future. Students will draw on both of these tools to develop scenarios that depict key aspects of the future in the Asia-Pacific region, building on course material and on their own expertise and research. By the end of the course, students will be able to analyze international developments in their areas of interest and to advocate new policies based on their analysis."

        "The central aim of the course is to develop an understanding of how different theories explain international politics and which are most persuasive. Theories are important because they define how we see the world and respond to it. We all use theory every time we think or talk about international relations (or any subject!). Our principal tasks in this course are to explicitly disentangle these theories, evaluate the logics behind them, and assess their merits and shortcomings. Although the term \"theory\" is often seen as dull, intimidating, or irrelevant, this course aims to refute these misconceptions. Theory is interesting, intuitive, and essential for understanding the world. While our general focus will be on theory, the course is designed to use theory to address an array of policy-relevant issues. Why do wars occur, and how can they be avoided? Are democracies really more peaceful than other types of governments? Where do international institutions come from, and do they promote cooperation? What is the relationship between states' economic and security policies? Can humans use ideas and cultural values to overcome barriers to peace and cooperation?"

        "Today, information technology fuels international politics in ways unimaginable just a few short years ago. Wars are fought online, social media platforms fuel genocide, and we carry in our pockets a computer millions of times more powerful than the one which landed humans on the moon.\u00a0This course takes students on deep dive into the impact of the information age on the discipline of international relations and the practice of international politics. The course will be structured around empirical material helping students to frame their understanding of the impact of the information age on International Relations. Students will tackle a range of topics, including the history and geopolitical impact of the internet, the concept of cyberwar, platform governance and information warfare. The course will approach these via key theoretical frameworks in International Relations, including constructivist, neorealist and critical approaches."

        "What is the future of war, and how can we begin to critically interpret what are often contested and divergent imagined futures? Should understandings of past wars inform future war theorizing? How might emerging technologies shape the future of war? What is the future status of soldiers in war, and how might human-machine teams radically alter the character of war? Drawing on conventional and critical war studies literature, we will examine how new and emerging trends in war practices and technology development together impact the drivers and dynamics of contemporary international conflict. This course interrogates the future potential(s) of war, considering military, state, soldier, and civilian perspectives across shifting ideological, societal, and technological contexts. We will deploy critical methods to examine future wars in relation to \u2018old\u2019 and \u2018new\u2019 wars, combat domains, logistics, nuclear war, netcentric war, counterterrorism, algorithmic war, the return of great power rivalry and the politics of war memory and commemoration. Upon completion of this course, students will be able to critically challenge deterministic framings of futuristic war considering geopolitical and strategic factors, and thus will be better equipped to separate fact from fiction in futuristic imaginings of war."

        "In Asia, the world's most rapidly growing region, politics and political regimes are diverse.\u00a0Asia is home to stable communist regimes, there are constitutional monarchies and military-based authoritarian governments, as well as young and vibrant democracies.\u00a0The region has also been marked by important political transformations where seemingly entrenched systems have been overturned, such as Indonesian\u2019s transition to democracy or Thailand\u2019s return to authoritarianism.\u00a0How should we understand the immense political variation that characterises this critical part of the world? In this course, we leverage key concepts from comparative political science in order to examine and explain the nature of contemporary Asia's political systems and recent political transformations.\u00a0The course has two main purposes: first, to introduce students to major theoretical ideas, paradigms and categories within political science; and, second, to apply these theories to the political dynamics of our region.\u00a0During the course, students will hear from a range of scholars with expertise in the domestic politics and international relations of North, South, and Southeast Asia, and we will cover a range of topics, including democratisation, authoritarianism, social activism, identity politics, and regional conflict.\u00a0In this way, students will emerge with broad knowledge of both politics as a discipline and political developments within Asia."

        "The course's aim is to give students a good understanding of the key social, political and conceptual issues underlying humanitarian ideas, actions and discourses. In an age marked by wars, large-scale displacements, pandemics and environmental disasters, humanitarian interventions have taken on a crucial role. While many humanitarian actors prioritize impartiality and neutrality in their ethics and practice, anthropological analyses can create more nuanced depictions of the multi-layered political, economic, social and cultural questions arising from humanitarian practices. Through readings from the burgeoning field of the anthropology of humanitarianism the course will address challenging questions, such as: Do we, as some anthropologists have suggested, live in an age of 'humanitarian reason' (Fassin 2012)? Where does this impulse to 'do good' (Hilhorst 2002) stem from? And how does this impulse correlate with local perceptions of help and being helped? What contradictions might arise from actions taken in the name of humanity?",
        "Interactive and team-based learning methods will encourage students to switch their roles from passive recipients of knowledge to becoming active co-creators of the course's shape and content. The first half of the course will be dedicated to identifying and discussing key concepts and ideas from the anthropology of humanitarianism as well as to the historical",
        "contextualization of contemporary forms of humanitarianism. By extending humanitarianism beyond the immediate realm of disaster relief responses, the course will make visible the powerful ways humanitarian ideas and practices interact with social, cultural and political realms. Having established a robust critical analytical framework, the second half of the course will be dedicated to humanitarian case studies. Based on students' interests and experiences, these ethnographic examples will shed light on the everyday micropolitics of humanitarian practices and highlight the complex social and cultural processes they involve."

As a field of study, international relations focuses on the political, military, economic, and cultural interaction of state and non-state actors at the global level. The field therefore encompasses a diverse array of topics, from the causes of war to the politics of development, from international institutions to the environment. In this course, we begin by exploring the key concepts, foundational events, issues, and processes of international relations in order to provide the general knowledge and analytic tools necessary to understand, evaluate, and respond to a complex array of problems in the contemporary world."

Focusing on the conjoined themes of making and display, we will examine the fundamental points of tension between handmade and mechanised production, the unique and the mass-produced, the studio and the factory, and the intersection of craft and design with digital platforms and technologies, from Instagram to 3D printing. A wide range of contemporary craft and design practices and ideas across Australia, Asia, Europe, and the Americas will be considered in terms of cultural context, social significance, historical inheritance, and systems of value (aesthetic, economic, political, spiritual and individual)."

        "This unit aims to develop the general skills of comparative lawyers, to effectively and critically assess contemporary developments in the legal system of one of the world's largest economies. 'Law' comprises the rules and norms that any society creates to govern how its members should interact with one another. Societal factors provide context to the legal system, and vice versa. To properly examine any country's laws and legal system one needs to have at least some degree of understanding of the dynamics and values of that society. The purpose of this course is to provide a foundation for understanding the history, place and use of law in modern Japan. The course covers the history, structure, and fundamental substantive areas of Japanese law. It investigates and challenges some common assumptions about the place of law in Japanese society, including Japan's legal history, judicial system, legal education, and legal profession. The course explores topics including the place of litigation in Japan, and the treatment of non-Japanese, women, and minorities.

These different sources of expertise, informal knowledge sharing pathways and social interactions are part of the knowledge systems in which policy-making is situated.",

Using a real-time online, virtual game it considers how people who hold Indigenous land rights, the agents that target their resources for extraction or conservation, and the various agencies and organisations involved in resource governance (mining and forestry) may compete."

Language, and different patterns of multilingualism, reflect and create social and cultural identities, and are intertwined with the social and political hierarchies that influence conflict and conflict resolution, equality and inequality, and processes of social stability and change. The language diversity of Asia and the Pacific is also influential on a global scale. The region is the source of some of the world\u2019s most widely used languages, as well as leading the global diversification of English.

        "This course gives an introduction to human language, its structure and how it can be described and analysed, as well as what all human languages have in common and how they differ. The methodology of linguistics (the scientific study of language) is introduced, focusing on the formulation of generalisations that say what all human languages share. The aim of the course is to give a conceptual framework for (1) critically thinking about and discussing language and language-related topics, and (2) aiding the acquisition of a second language. Students will engage with diverse languages, including Indigenous Australian languages and other languages of the Asia-Pacific and from around the globe. The course will be of interest to any student who wishes to learn more about language and is an essential foundation for further studies in linguistics."

        "Modern history is replete with struggles that have resulted in political decisions about language use; some languages are designated as \u2018official\u2019 state languages, others are side-lined or even erased. In the modern state, language tests are powerful tools of policy. They can be used to reduce the risk of miscommunication in the workplace, or to measure educational achievement, but they can also be used to filter linguistic diversity or to exclude certain groups. Starting from the concept of \u2018a language\u2019, this course explores the complex relationships between language use, language acquisition, and mechanisms, such as policies, standardized tests and assessment processes. Throughout the course, there is an emphasis on both theory and practice. Students will examine a range of policy contexts and learn about the principles of language test design and validation, enabling them to make critical and informed connections between government or institutional policies, their instruments and the sociopolitical priorities that drive them. They will have the opportunity to explore a particular assessment or policy context in detail. The course is co-constructed: students will contribute to the course content by selecting and reporting on case studies of interest to them. They will gain exposure to a range of relevant genres, including assessment instruments, policy documents, public information, popular media and academic studies."

While artists have often turned the spirit of justice and the power of the law into visual form, they have also been prominent critics of it. Injustice and suffering are given a vivid presence and emotional weight through the visual arts, in ways that have often led the law to fear its capacity to disturb and challenge us.",
        "This course introduces students to a flourishing new area of transdisciplinary study. It provides an overview of key texts that introduce theories and methods in law and visual studies. The course then explores a diverse range of topical case studies that examine law through art and art through law, including themes such as Justice, Power, Ideology, Colonialism, Environment, and War. Students will embark on an intellectual journey from the Ghazi Stadium in Kabul to the Supreme Court of Mexico, and from nineteenth-century Van Diemen\u2019s Land to contemporary Australian masterworks. Throughout this journey, students will learn to perceive both law and art through new perspectives, fundamentally transforming their understanding of these fields.",

Students will learn how the tools of economics can be used to help address complex regulatory challenges such as climate-compatible regulation of trade and investment. Introducing the interdisciplinary field of Law & Economics through analysis of current regulatory challenges, this course reflects the ANU College of Law\u2019s commitment to transdisciplinary teaching.",

Students will learn how both qualitative and quantitative empirical approaches can be used to study both the causes and consequences of regulation. The focus with regard to methodologies will be on understanding when different methodologies are likely to be appropriate, and how to interpret findings. As such, this course should be seen as a complement to, but not substitute for a general \"methods\" course.",
        "In this course, students will gain an understanding of both the strengths and limitations of economic approaches to regulatory design. Importantly the course clearly distinguishes between neoclassical economics and neoliberal ideology, between welfare and financial wealth. Examples include the application of welfare-economy theory to critically analyse current international investment agreements, or to illustrate the logic behind trade-related climate policies such as carbon border adjustments. These examples will also be used to illustrate the limits of neoclassical economics regarding questions of distribution of welfare. Similarly, the limitations of Chicago-school Law & Economics a la Coase will be explored. Understanding strengths and limitations of the economic approach will allow students to both design and critically analyse regulatory proposals based on economic rationale."

        "Law, at its heart, is a human endeavour. It is deeply impacted by the way in which people think, feel, and behave. Accordingly, psychology is a useful framework for understanding many legal issues. In particular, psychology illuminates: the conflicts that inspire legal doctrines; the quirks of lawmaker, juries, and judges; and the challenges that occur when a legal system is imposed on individuals. Indeed, many wrongful convictions in Australia can be understood through psychology, such as mistaken eyewitness memories and the pressures that lead to false confessions. The broader connection between psychology and law was recently highlighted when Richard Thaler won the 2017 Nobel Prize in Economics for his work in this area.",
        "We will explore the study and practice of law through the lens of empirically-tested psychological theories. The course begins with an examination of the three major groups involved in a legal action: the parties to the actions, the judges, and the jury. These topics provide a firm theoretical understanding of classic psychological processes (i.e., attitudinal biases, decision-making, and social cognition) as applied to legal concepts. The course builds on this theoretical framework to explore specific areas of law, such as intellectual property and evidence. We end on a practical slant, studying how to use the science of well-being to build a healthy and sustainable law practice."

The topics and readings will be centred on the theme of the 'Foundations of Law'. The theme bears an allusion to the first-year compulsory course that all law students at the ANU have to take: the 'Foundations of Australian Law'. However, in this elective course, we are interested in a different kind of foundation. We will interrogate not the foundations of any particular legal system, but the foundations of law itself. Whereas the 'Foundations of Australian Law' equips students with the foundational skills of legal reasoning, this elective course invites students to take a step back to consider and interrogate the foundational mythologies of law. We will explore the 'Foundations of Law' through the humanistic disciplines of classics, literature, philosophy and theology: we will read classical plays (e.g. Antigone), contemporary novels (e.g. Lord of the Flies), philosophical works (e.g. Genealogy of Morals), and theological writings (e.g. Genesis and Exodus). These texts present different modes and means of inquiring into the assumptions and aspirations that we ascribe to law."

        "Legal education generally relies upon two unsustainable demarcations: first, it separates law from politics and economics and, secondly, it treats legal fields (contracts, constitutional law, property etc) separately from each other. Generally speaking, private law is equated with \u2018economics\u2019 and public law with \u2018politics\u2019. These demarcations are neither intellectually rigorous nor practically useful. For that reason, the proposed course aims to bridge these gaps. It will offer our students an opportunity to bring together different strands of their studies, including public and private as well as domestic and international law. In so doing, the course will invite students to think about how law creates the concepts and institutions that sustain economic production and circulation in Australia and globally. Additionally, it will give students the tools to understand the changing ideas about the relationship between law and political economy that have underpinned common law legal systems for the past 150 years."

Students will critically assess the implications of issues for themselves, relating to Indigenous peoples, and relating to the future of law and justice in Australia. As such, the course builds on concepts introduced in Lawyers, Justice and Ethics, Australian Public Law, International Law and Property Law.",

Improvements in \u2018quality of life\u2019 over the centuries have eliminated some of these problems, and reduced others, but in the process perhaps left us less equipped to cope with the difficulties we still must face. Luckily, wisdom can be found in the peoples of the ancient Mediterranean, who had a particularly rich repertoire for expressing some of these universal human problems through the arts and literature. But they also had singular ways of processing them through philosophical reframing. This course will study a suite of these universal human \u2018problems\u2019 such as death, illness, anguish and love, and will engage students in the material and literary evidence that demonstrates how the peoples of ancient Greece and Rome confronted problems with the help of various artistic and aesthetic processing modes: from the consolations of literature and inscriptions, to the mythic therapies of funerary art, to the cathartic qualities of music and drama.

A command of Literary Chinese is therefore indispensable for the study of any aspect of Chinese literature, thought, history, politics, or society before the twentieth century.The idioms, syntax, style, and allusions of Literary Chinese continue to pervade the modern language. Its enduring influence results from the fact that the great legacies of Chinese culture, right down to the present day, have been largely preserved in this medium. Contemporary Chinese political and social discourse, and education, places increasing emphasis on knowledge of pre-modern Chinese culture and on familiarity with texts written in Literary Chinese. So without a grounding in Literary Chinese, it is impossible to gain a full understanding of the language or content of newspaper articles, literary works, and scholarly prose written in contemporary Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the People's Republic of China. It has also shaped the linguistic and cultural traditions of Korea, Japan, and Vietnam.This course focuses on the analysis and translation of a selection of texts for beginners from the pre-Qin (before 221 BC) and Han (206 BC to 220 AD) periods. Students develop an understanding of the main grammatical forms, function words, and sentence patterns of this formative period of Literary Chinese. Students will also study techniques of translation, as well as the cultural backgrounds essential to understanding the texts at hand."

Through this it is hoped that students will not only gain a deeper understanding of specific texts and writers but will also better understand the range of issues and competing and contradictory narratives that shape modern Japanese culture. Secondly,  through reading and discussion, the course seeks to develop students' understanding of critical theory and its practical application in textual analysis. Finally, the course seeks to help students develop and refine their research, analytical and critical writing skills, culminating in a research essay drawing on primary and secondary sources and compliant with relevant academic conventions.

        "In the increasingly connected global economy, businesses participate in supply chains that span across national borders to diversify risk, enable speciation, and create collaborative synergy in their efforts of value-creation. A global network of supply chain partners facilitates the purchasing, production, and distribution activities of multinational companies to create value in products or services for international markets. Effective and efficient management of the global supply chain can enhance the global competitiveness of firms. Using a combination of lectures, case studies and seminar discussion, the course explores the main issues in global supply chain management (SCM) to underline their strategic importance to firms. It first places SCM in the context of international business. It then discusses the core concepts of SCM, supply chain strategies, and key operations. The later part of the course focuses on the designing of global supply chain to counter risks, enhance efficiency, and promote sustainability."

        "The entry into force of the United Nations Charter in 1945 has corresponded with increasing maritime security concerns and responses by the UN Security Council, especially when exercising its powers under Chapter VII of the Charter. These concerns have especially been reflected in numerous Security Council Resolutions mandating naval operations, and more generally military operations, to maintain international peace and security. UN-mandated naval operations were significant in the sanctions regime imposed against Iraq (1990-2003) during which time extensive state practice developed in this field, and more recently the sanctions imposed against North Korea have continued this action by the Security Council. The Security Council has also mandated member states to conduct military operations at sea to combat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, international terrorism, and piracy. The maritime enforcement responses to piracy off the coast of Somalia have been among the most significant maritime security developments in the past century. Challenges to the normative maritime security law framework, including the myriad of issues that have arisen in the South China Sea dispute, will also be critically examined in this course.",

The exploration of musical acoustics incorporates aspects of frequency, sound envelopes, and amplitude measurement. These principles then inform a grounding in the key concepts and skills of musical practice, including the consideration of diatonic pitch space, its systems of documentation, and the ways in which we use it to explain relationships between musical sounds. An understanding of the components of sound also informs the ways in which we perceive, analyse, manipulate and articulate the sounds of music. Techniques of critical listening are introduced in multiple contexts, from the exploration of the frequency content of sound through spectral solfege, to the perception of pitch relationships within diatonic pitch space. Techniques for the analysis of musical sound are introduced which are foundational for the future studies of the music practitioner, technologist, and analyst alike."

The other marked component of the year is the presentation of a recent research paper to foster skills in critical analysis of the literature. Most students in this honours course are expected to be doing projects with supervisors based in the John Curtin School of Medical Research, in the disciplines of Cancer Biology and Therapeutics, Genome Biology, Immunology and Infectious Diseases, or Neuroscience. However projects may be undertaken in laboratories in the Research School of Biology, other Schools at ANU where a group has a focus on medical research, or The Canberra Hospital at the discretion of the convenor.

Students benefit directly from academic staff research-led teaching as the course is structured around seminar presentations and responses by a range of guest lectures. Aligning with the SOAD research hubs the course also involves visits to collections and displays at national institutions where different examples of research approaches are tested.",

The course seeks to de-mystify the modern states and societies of the AP, encompassing those of the Gulf monarchies (Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Oman) and Yemen. Drawing on new theoretical interventions, methodologies, and transnational approaches, as well as a wide range of sources (archival material, travelogues, colonial reports, audiovisuals, and local scholarship), the course aims to equip students with the research skillset needed to effectively analyse and discuss the political, security, and societal dynamics of the AP. The themes discussed in the course will be wide-ranging, and will include topics and issues such as the AP's place within the ever-changing Middle Eastern regional order, post-oil societal transformations, popular mobilizations, the politics of climate change and food security, authoritarian resilience, the risk of state collapse, the empowering/de-stabilizing role of technology, among others. Much of these discussions will be shaped by key questions - how have AP states and societies evolved in the past and present, and what factors and trends will shape their future course of development?"

Working across diverse case studies, including Nazism, settler colonialism, and military commemoration, we will work with a diverse range of historical evidence to assess the ways in which understandings of nation have been shaped and contested through collective memory and memorialisation. Through an examination of public ceremony and commemoration, educational intervention and institutional design, trials, museum exhibitions, individual memory, literature, popular culture and historiography, we will examine how the memory and representation of national identities have been debated and transformed. At a time of heightened political engagement with questions of recognition in public culture, and the power of testimony in challenging collective representation, this course will encourage reflection on the particular and contestable power of 'the nation' in framing what is remembered and what is forgotten."

Beyond the headlines and the politics, how can we distinguish what really constitutes a national security threat? How can we critically assess the security policy responses that governments make? This course equips students with conceptual and analytical skills and frameworks to address these core questions.",

Students will apply these tools to texts ranging from Australian government policy statements to canonical scholarly works to illuminate their strengths and weaknesses. Students will interact with policy practitioners to understand how conceptual frameworks help explain the ways in which contemporary security challenges are understood by government. The course concludes by setting the scene for a subsequent course on translating conceptual analysis into making policy.

        "Conflicts over natural resources are an enduring feature of social and political life at different scales and levels of organisation. The inter-state and geopolitical dimensions of conflicts over resources such as oil and water and marine resources loom large in the popular imaginary. Resource conflicts in the Asia-Pacific are predominantly intra-state, fought internally, within the boundaries of the nation-state, but often involving claims to various forms of \u2018internal\u2019 self-determination or secession (\u2018external\u2019 self-determination). According to the United Nations, at least 40 per cent of internal conflicts globally are related to natural resources. Examining such conflicts in the Asia-Pacific region is the focus of this course.",
        "A striking conundrum lies at the heart of the inquiry: rather than\u00a0contributing to peace and prosperity, empirical research demonstrates that natural resource wealth increases the likelihood of countries experiencing internal violent conflict. How and why is this the case? Is resource scarcity a driver of violent conflict in such contexts? What policy responses and interventions are available, and where secessionist demands become a factor, what solutions are available in terms of decentralisation or either \u2018internal\u2019 or \u2018external\u2019 self-determination? How might natural resource wealth contribute to peace rather than to conflict? What roles do political and economic contestation play in conflicts over land, sea, and natural resources?",
        "The course will be structured around a series of case studies drawn from Asia and the Pacific. In terms of theory, first, a political ecology framework will be applied to the analysis of differing natural resource conflicts, and second, a political/legal lens will aid analysis of ways that decentralisation or self-determination may prevent or resolve such conflict. Alongside these case studies, students will undertake their own analysis of a natural resource conflict in which they will be attentive to the role of different actors - especially the state, communities (including secessionist movements), and corporations - and to questions of scale, power and identity.",
        "The course will apply a research-led approach to teaching and learning. In addition to core expertise housed in the Department of Pacific Affairs (ANU), it draws upon expertise from other parts of the ANU.

        "Negotiation and conflict resolution are central features of the study and practice of diplomacy. This course explores the causes of conflict (and peace) and examines various mechanisms that are employed by the international community in an attempt to address interstate and intrastate conflict. It also provides students with an opportunity to study the theory and practice of the essential diplomatic art of negotiation. This course introduces and examines the international framework for negotiation and conflict resolution. It surveys the causes and character of conflict and explores a wide range of mechanisms for inter-state and intra-state conflict resolution. Three broad and topical concepts of diplomacy - 'preventive diplomacy', 'coercive diplomacy' and 'peacebuilding diplomacy' - are used to demarcate different phases and types of conflict management. In our consideration of preventive diplomacy we examine the preventive measures of peaceful settlement contained in Chapter VI of the United Nations Charter, such as negotiation, mediation, arbitration and adjudication. In our examination of coercive diplomacy we discuss coercive measures for preventing and resolving conflict, such as sanctions and use of force provided for in Chapter VII of the UN Charter. Finally, we use the notion of peacebuilding diplomacy to examine the mechanisms that help shape peacebuilding interventions in conflict and post-conflict zones, such as peace processes and multidimensional peace operations.",
        "As part of this course students undertake an intensive negotiation workshop. This flagship element of the Master of Diplomacy program provides students with first-hand exposure to the challenges of managing conflict through diplomatic negotiation. You will acquire and refine new negotiation and mediation skills and techniques through a variety of learning methods, including workshop discussion, demonstration, practice and simulation. The Negotiation Workshop aims to develop the ability of students to think politically and strategically, to examine key elements in the planning and conduct of negotiation and mediation, to identify essential qualities and skills for effective negotiation and mediation, and to consolidate this knowledge through practical exercises that simulate real-world diplomatic negotiations."

        "The horrors that a nuclear conflict could unleash upon the world were made plain in 1945 in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The intervening years have seen a significant increase in the number of states known or believed to possess such weapons, and a continuing reliance, (pivotal during the Cold War but no less important in the post-Cold War era), on nuclear deterrence as a factor in maintaining peace among the global powers. Given the proliferation of nuclear weapons that has taken place, there is a recognisable need for mutual assurance among States, both nuclear and otherwise. A key contributing element in that required mutual assurance is nuclear command, control and communications (NC3). The global community needs to be assured that all nuclear weapon-armed States have effective and robust NC3 arrangements in place. But what are the rules that regulate this most terrifying of weapons?",
        "This course will take students through the diverse elements of the applicable law, showing how that law can make sense in the extreme circumstances of nuclear war. After examining ideas of sovereignty and jurisdiction, we will consider the law as it applies to the use of nuclear force and to the conduct of nuclear operations during an armed conflict. International crimes, neutrality and national doctrine will be addressed and the continued relevance, or otherwise, of a pivotal opinion of the International Court of Justice (dating from the mid-1990s) will be assessed. We will review the significance of a treaty, adopted a few years ago, that would ban nuclear weapons, and we will try to draw conclusions for the future of NC3.",
        "The course is structured into lectures, with distinct topics within each lecture. In the associated seminars, students will work through practical problems in sub-groups thereafter presenting and discussing their proposed solutions in the plenary setting. Some background understanding of international law as it affects conflict would be a desirable advantage, but the course is taught on the basis of no prior knowledge.",

        "All primates (non-human and human) have the capacity for flexible biological responses to environmental change. Due to the wide range of environments in which primate species are found this flexibility often results in extreme adaptability in diet and food intake. This course looks at this dietary flexibility and how it may impact or limit nutritional intake across time and space and in turn how this may impact issues of health and population viability. Using both cross-species and cross-cultural comparative approaches this course will specifically explore how nutrition relates to disease dynamics and health in various physical environments across all primates, both extinct and extant. In the first part of the course, we will look at nutrition and disease through the lens of human behavioural ecology. Topics include evolutionary medicine, foraging models, parental investment and parent-offspring conflict, and host-pathogen coevolution. In the second part, we will consider evidence from the fossil record to understand the evolution of extinct hominin diets over the last 4 million years,\u00a0physical and behavioural adaptations to different environments, and the relationship between nutrition and brain size increases in our extinct hominin ancestors and relatives; In the third part we will think about models of food selection from a primatology perspective and how data from non-human primates can be used to better understand patterns of over and undernutrition in humans along with how patterns of change in nutritional intake can impact pregnancy outcomes and child development."

The course has a focus on the study of the human body and employs professional life models. Each week students are presented with different tasks and approaches to seeing and drawing observationally by identifying space, shape, form, line, gesture, expression, movement, colour, tone, and composition. The experience of drawing is broadened by testing a variety of drawing mediums and processes through haptic exploration. In class students build up a substantial portfolio of work for assessment and extend their drawing skills through take-home, guided, and self-directed activities. A deeper knowledge of drawing in context of historical and contemporary art and design practices is furthered through weekly tutorial slide presentations, written and oral critical reflections. This observational drawing course is relevant to students with any level of experience and from all visual arts and design disciplines. This course is fun, challenging and rewarding. Observational Drawing is designed to build confidence and provide invaluable foundational drawing skills that are applicable to all disciplines in new media, visual art, design and art history and theory."

        "The Pacific islands has been at the centre of geopolitical  and diplomatic contestations. Since 2009 there has been a fundamental shift in the way that the Pacific Island states engage with regional and world politics. The region has experienced what former Kiribati President Anote Tong aptly called a 'paradigm shift' in ideas about how Pacific diplomacy should be organised, and on what principles it should operate. Many leaders have called for a heightened Pacific voice in global affairs and a new commitment to establishing Pacific Island control of diplomatic processes.",

This 'new' Pacific diplomacy has seen real success in diplomatic outcomes in key sectors of global negotiations for Pacific states such as fisheries, climate policy, decolonisation and trade.",

This course will expose students to the economic issues facing the Pacific island region, including Papua New Guinea and Timor-Leste. It will also relate economic performance to underlying political features and challenges. It will explore both the distinctive features of the various Pacific island economies and some of the common challenges they face and strategies they can adopt in relation to migration and aid.

In the past we come to understand the voyages that brought people to the region and the stories they tell about their journeys. We investigate colonisation, the impact it had and still has on the region, and the different ways it can be understood. In the recent present we examine the new voyages that Pacific people have taken into places like Australia, New Zealand and the United States. In doing so we look at how people move within and between these new boundaries and how Pacific cultures and identities have evolved over time and place. Finally, we bring all of these themes together by examining how the past and the present can help us imagine the future.This course will be taught in Japan (in English) as part of the Bachelor of Asia Pacific Affairs."

        "The past, the present and the future. These are all aspects of environmental change that palaeoecologists attempt to understand. In essence, palaeoecology enables us to venture back in time and reconstruct landscapes of the past, with much of our understanding of these deep time environmental histories based on the microscopic fossil remains of plants and animals found in sedimentary sequences. There is a rich body of this kind of evidence from around the world and Australia is a fascinating part of the global story.",
        "Participants are introduced to the science of reconstructing past environments through a hands-on research project designed around an environmental research question. Students explore the classic methods and techniques used to understand deep time environmental change through the collection of sedimentary sequences and the laboratory analysis of a number of palaeoenvironmental indicators, such as pollen and charcoal. These two proxy data types reveal what was growing in the landscape at different times in the past and how often it burnt.",

This course begins by examining the mechanisms available for bringing about peaceful resolutions to conflict and war. We seek to analyse the prospects for peace in the 21st century through a close engagement with examples of conflict resolution and peacebuilding from across the Asia-Pacific region. These case-studies each illustrate different challenges and approaches to conflict resolution and peace building. Students will be encouraged to consider the communication strategies, attitudes towards justice, political instincts and other practical attributes that are relevant to resolving conflict and building peace in such contexts. To facilitate a hands-on appreciation of those attributes, the course includes a hypothetical exercise designed to challenge us to look at peace efforts from a variety of real-world perspectives.The ANU uses Turnitin to enhance student citation and referencing techniques, and to assess assignment submissions as a component of the University's approach to managing Academic Integrity.

Overall, the thematic topics include: theories of disease causation and healing efficacy; medicalization and the scientific gaze; production of medical knowledge; mental health; public health discourse and risk; the internationalization of pharmaceutical research; the possibilities and perils of new medical technologies; emergent forms of everyday health practices; the ethics of medical tourism; and health inequities. The objective is to provide an overview of theoretical and applied social scientific approaches to the study of culture, health, and medicine."

        "For millions of people across the world, violent conflict remains a persistent and tragic reality. In this course, we interrogate how issues of peace and conflict both imprint themselves on and are interpreted through Australian political life. We will look at the \u201cscripts\u201d that shape how Australians understand war, consider the conditioning role that \u201cperspective\u201d plays in those scripts, and extend the concepts we cover to address contemporary \u201cconfrontations\u201d in global politics. The course will draw on a range of different texts and materials, from academic journal articles to novels and museum exhibitions. It will also tackle a series of historical and contemporary issues, from the colonisation of this land, to the role played by the AIF in World War One, to AUKUS. We will, along the way, be challenged to confront, on the one hand, the relationship between the Australian state and war, and, on the other, the part we as citizens play in reproducing and/or contesting that relationship. The overarching question, then, that this class encourages us to address is: How does Peace & Conflict Studies help us to think about violent conflict today, and what does it look like when viewed from Canberra?"

        "Did you know that worldwide, women tend to live longer than men, but spend more years in ill health? Or that women do more unpaid work in the home, while they earn less money in the labor market than men, even for equal work? Or that highly educated women are more likely to migrate to a different country for work than highly educated men? This course will examine sex and gender differences in population processes (health & mortality, family & fertility, household & the labor market, migration), and critically investigate where these gender inequalities come from, why they are so persistent, and what could be done about them. We will engage in transdisciplinary perspective taking and address these population issues from different social science angles. While an empirical dichotomisation of \u201csex\u201d into male and female is often central to population research, what do demographers mean when they talk about sex difference? How do their concepts of sex and gender, and approaches to understanding and explaining gender inequalities, overlap with those from other disciplines? How do they deal with non-binary gender identities? What are other disciplines\u2019 perspective on these gendered issues, and how does research from different fields on these issues speak to each other? We will explore answers to these questions and develop a \u2018gendered\u2019 understanding of a variety of issues in population studies, examining them through the lenses of theories and perspectives from demography, sociology, gender studies, and economics."

It is difficult to understand how minds fit into the physical world and interact with material things. It is hard to explain how minds are capable of representing the world. And it is a deep mystery how conscious experience relates to our bodies and brains. This course will take a philosophical approach to these questions, exploring some of the metaphysical and conceptual issues that underlie psychological and neuroscientific explanations. We will begin by grappling with the Mind/Body problem via discussion of dualism, mind-body identity, functionalism, computationalism and connectionism. We will consider the frame problem and embodied cognition as well as issues concerning mental representation. We will examine the hard problem of consciousness and its central arguments. We will also consider the nature of reductive or mechanistic explanation and how they might bear on the nature and possibilities of free will."

That consensus has frayed in recent years, with new approaches emerging.",

With the \u2018Computational Theory of Mind\u2019 as our foundation, we will learn how to model the brain using Turing-machines and neural network models. The second module engages with contemporary research programmes that, to various extents, argue against the consensus view. They argue the mind is inextricably linked with the body and the world, and so the dynamic interplay between them is the key to cognition. The final module situates intelligence in a broader evolutionary context.

The primary method of testing whether physical theories are correct is through comparison of theoretical predictions with measurements of physical properties. Indeed, it could be said that the pursuit of ever more accurate and precise measurements is the bedrock of modern physics. The Physics Advanced Laboratory course will consist of lectures, smaller laboratory experiments, computational exercises, and, most importantly, the design and performance of complex, open-ended experiments using high-end equipment in real research laboratories, such as high precision lasers and a 15MV electrostatic tandem accelerator. The course is designed to develop the essential scientific and laboratory techniques required by experimental physicists, as well as oral and written communication skills, self-reliance, trouble-shooting abilities and a sophisticated understanding of measurement uncertainty."

        "The structure and dynamic processes of the Earth are measured, quantified and understood by utilizing principles and methods from the physical sciences. Core areas of study include seismology, geodynamics, geodesy and geophysical fluid dynamics. A variety of course work from these fields is on offer, in addition to a supervised research project worth 50% of the final mark. The goal of Physics of the Earth Honours is to gain a solid grounding in quantitative analysis of physical processes based on both theory and observation. For example, plate tectonics, in which distinct pieces of the rigid outer shell of the Earth constantly move and interact due to internal heating, manifests in seismic (e.g. earthquakes), geodetic (e.g. GPS displacement) and geodynamic (e.g. crustal deformation) observation. Evidence from these fields of study have been central to gaining a better understanding of convection within the Earth's mantle, and how the continents have shifted and deformed over time. More specifically, coursework will cover seismic wave propagation, earthquake source mechanisms and seismic imaging; fundamental concepts in fluid dynamics and their application to the Earth (e.g. Buoyancy driven flow in the ocean); sea level change and variations in polar ice cap volumes from satellite data; the physical behaviour of minerals and rocks at pressures and temperatures encountered deep within the Earth; and theory and numerical methods for solving geophysical inverse and data inference problems."

        "This course will provide you with a solid background in plant function in relation to global climate change and enable you to answer this question at scales ranging from cellular function to community processes.\u00a0The course is structured around six topic modules selected to expose students to current research areas in the field. ANU has a high research profile in different aspects of how environmental factors and global climate change affect plant function and ecology and each module is taught by an expert lecturer. The specific topics may vary between years depending on lecturers. The course will have a broad content ranging from topics as fundamental as how: plants take up carbon from the atmosphere through photosynthesis and how this uptake of carbon is linked to the use of water; changing environmental factors such as temperatures affect plant function; the biotic environment is crucial in determining how plants acquire nutrients and their responses to changes in the global climate; and, climate change is leading to increased mortality of plants \u2013 often described as \u2018dieback\u2019 \u2013 in ecosystems across the globe.",

Understanding how pollution causes harm, and how it is measured, assessed, and regulated, are key to mitigating pollution impacts on Earth and its inhabitants. The course will be delivered by industry experts, from federal and state government regulators through to pollution consultants and researchers conducting work on the ground, through a combination of lectures and workshops on the science of pollution. Discussions related to policy, regulations, and societal issues will also be held.

Very few countries have official, or explicit, population policies, but many social policies are a result of demographic change, or are designed to influence demographic change. There are many examples of policies that have unintended consequences on the growth of populations, while in other cases, despite demographic pressures, policy interventions have been absent. The reasons governments take these approaches will be considered. The course will also examine policy instruments that have been used across the world to understand their approach and their effects. Students will complete a case study report that analyse a range of policies, both population and non-population related, to evaluate the effects \u2013 intended or otherwise \u2013 on population. In completing this course, students will think critically on how demographic methods and theory apply to real-world policy problems, while considering how demographic policy may be critiqued and improved from a range of disciplinary perspectives."

        "Why is clear military superiority, such as that enjoyed by the United States, seemingly unable to influence the behaviour of targets in many instances? Does China's rapidly growing economy\u00a0endow it with a potent economic instrument of power? Is the soft power of the West declining amid global financial crisis and domestic political turmoil? Who is winning the contest of great powers in the 21st century? This course focuses on puzzles like these, examining how power is accumulated and wielded in international relations, and the conditions under which its use can be successful. States are the primary focus of the course, and five primary modes of power will be studied: military power, economic power, technological power, soft power and hegemonic power. The objective of this course is to provide the student with a broad and deep understanding of how power can be conceptualised, measured, and deployed in international relations, and the conditions for its successful use. The course considers a wide range of contemporary issues and case studies and will analyse both the capacity of and limitations on states to wield different types of power successfully."

It analyses varying models of social welfare provision and social protection as well as fundamental policy issues, such as the merits of targeting versus universality, horizontal versus vertical equity, and rights-based versus discretionary entitlements. The course then considers social protection in the context of key groups of potential beneficiaries, including people who are unemployed, children and families, retirees, and indigenous peoples.

        "Most of the world's population live in cities, where many of the world's big challenges combine, from climate change to inequality.\u00a0To meet contemporary challenges, it is imperative that policy makers can measure the demographic and economic drivers behind urbanisation patterns as well as understand their social and environmental outcomes. It is equally imperative that policy makers have the skills to work collectively with communities, political leaders as well as for-profit and non-profit organisations to guide decision-making on complex urban problems in a way that builds resilient cities. This involves an integrated approach to examining urban problems and designing solutions that can weigh up economic development considerations with social policy priorities as well as environmental management needs.",
        "This course is designed for those interested in complex urban problems and integrating policy making to build more resilient cities. It provides an overview of common problems faced in cities over time as part of urbanisation processes and utilises urban and governance theory to consider different interpretations of these problems. Students will also utilise different analytical techniques to study these multifaceted problems. Then, some contemporary solutions designed to resolve complex urban problems are examined, with a particular focus on governance approaches that integrate policy areas in cities, for example in programs relating to urban renewal and informal settlement upgrading to large-scale infrastructure planning and urban river basin management. In this regard, attention is given to the important collaborative, boundary spanning and inter-jurisdictional work required of public policy practitioners in working to address complex urban problems.",
        "Students will be invited to imagine themselves in the situation of other actors in the urban policy making and governance process so as to understand and empathise with different perspectives in a way that seeks agreement without avoiding conflict nor striving for consensus."

        "The course draws on sociological concepts of gender, ethnicity, socio-economic status, social closure and intersectionality, which serve as the foundation for student collaborative research. Additionally, students develop skills to use and critically assess quantitative methods used to generate EDI data. Two distinct streams are available: the beginner stream and the application stream for students with prior exposure to computational and statistical methods.",
        "The main objective of this course is to enable participants to learn, share, consolidate and apply a range of EDI theories and quantitative methodologies used by social scientists and data scientists, including the use of appropriate software. The unit adopts a student-centred approach, with teaching and learning centred around a research project designed and completed individually or in teams throughout the course. By the end of the semester, students will have acquired the practical skills and theoretical knowledge necessary to advance EDI practices in diverse institutional settings."

        "This course offers a multidisciplinary, collaborative and co-constructed pedagogical journey on re-imagining International Relations (IR) using race as an analytical, methodological and ethical lens. It is aimed at destabilising \u2018settled\u2019 knowledge, interlocutors, and scholarly positions. Students will be challenged and invited to actively shape their learning outcomes as part of meaningful inclusion and diversity in the study of IR. The course begins with an examination of how ideas of race shapes and is shaped by imperialism, violence and global politics through a close reading of selected texts, and by interrogating the complicity of key IR concepts on security, human rights and development. The course then takes on a \u2018deep dive\u2019 into thematic issues in IR such as transnational social movements, climate change and refugee \u2018crises\u2019. The remainder of the course opens up for critical dialogues on re-imagining a future where race is considered not as an \u2018add-on\u2019 but as an indispensable starting point for generosity and a more truthful accounting of IR."

We will examine the historical processes which gradually encouraged this diversity to be read both as evidence of permanent, innate, 'racial' difference and justification for socio-political inequality, or 'racist' discrimination. The course considers the concept of 'race' within the contexts of the development of scientific knowledge regarding the natural world and the intellectual history of what it was to be human. Students will explore how these ideas shaped colonisation and chattel slavery; nationalism and empire; segregation and sexuality; and eugenics and genocide."

        "This course examines what it means to be 'rational' in negotiating the world and conducting one's life. At issue is the quality of one\u2019s beliefs, desires and choices about how to act, particularly in the face of uncertainty, and in concert with others.",
        "Part I is a critical examination of the standard theory of individual rationality - expected utility theory \u2013 that unites and explicates the aforementioned key mental attitudes. This theory stems from the classic work of philosophers/social scientists such as Ramsey, de Finetti and Savage. Contemporary challenges to the standard theory come from diverse directions, with some arguing that the theory is too little constrained and even vacuous, and others arguing that it is too rigid, either in its prescriptions for representing and handling uncertainty or else by virtue of being in conflict with some prominent ethical accounts of right action. The course considers these challenges to the standard theory and the responses/developments they have inspired.",
        "Part II turns to rationality in a social context. One question is how collective judgments should depend on the judgments of the individual members. This question is pursued in the context of democratic theory, where the focus is on the procedure by which a group should decide on actions or attitudes to jointly adopt. This question is also pursued in the context of social welfare or choice theory, where the focus is on determining the collective preference ranking over social states that best represents, or is the most appropriate aggregate of, the respective individual preference rankings. A rather different sort of question is what an individual should do when the consequences of their choice depend on what others do, and vice versa. This is the province of game theory. Standard solution concepts for games are introduced, but the focus is on the limits of these solutions\u2014when collective-action problems arise. Bargaining theory is introduced as a way of negotiating these collective-action problems (amongst other sorts of problems); it may be seen as an intermediary between game theory and social welfare or choice theory."

From there it turns to the study of ASEAN in Southeast Asia, examining the reasons for its creation, how it has grown over time and how this growth can be understood theoretically. Each week pairs together conceptual arguments about how and why something happens with the empirical case of Southeast Asia, exemplifying the importance of the region for both applying and building our frameworks of analysis."

        "Responsible management of Australia's nuclear capabilities is a complex regulatory problem. Australia exports, but does not enrich, uranium; it uses nuclear technology for scientific and medical purposes, but not for power generation; it is globally ranked as a leading exponent of nuclear safeguards but is also a partner in AUKUS -- the 2021 agreement between Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States to share defence technologies and know-how. Amongst other things, this commits Australia to developing a nuclear-propelled submarine fleet. To do this, Australia must manage the life-cycle of multiple mobile reactors, their fuel and their environments. AUKUS makes Australia unique, as the first non-nuclear power to adopt nuclear technology for non-peaceful purposes. This course unpacks the multi-layered, multi-actor landscape of Australia's nuclear capabilities at the domestic, multilateral and international level. It examines the legal and regulatory frameworks and institutions for managing civilian and military applications; the risks that attach to civilian and military applications of nuclear materials and how these risks are managed; the regulatory culture of nuclear technologies and the organisations responsible for them; and how current and future domestic frameworks connect to Australia's transnational and global obligations."

        "As we have seen from recent debates over whether statues of controversial historical figures should stand or topple, culture is a constant collective decision-making process about what we should remember and what we should forget. The cultures of the Roman empire were no different. In the Greek east, authors and monument-makers of the \u2018second sophistic\u2019 looked back to culturally defining memories like the Trojan war, the Persian wars, and the high watermark of classical Athens; in the Roman west, equivalent writers and artists looked back to the myths of early Rome and the problematic benchmark of the Late Republic. At the same time, recent pasts could be rubbed out or overwritten at the drop of a hat: when an unpopular emperor died, their trace could be swept away via official memory sanctions decreeing the decapitation of their statues and the erasure of their inscriptions. In this course, you will learn about how and why Greeks and Romans of the imperial period decided to memorialise certain things and suppress others; you will read texts and study monuments, but also learn how the imperial-era ancients conceived of these very technologies as media of memory with different capabilities and characteristics; and you will go deep not only into \u2018the past of the past\u2019, but into how that past pictured its future: the confidence of endurance mixed with the fear of oblivion."

        "This course encourages students to explore the relationship between social justice and museums with a focus on repatriation. It highlights the role that repatriation has and can play in advancing social justice, and the obstacles and responding strategies that have been presented. Participants will explore the role of repatriation as a social movement and investigate its influence in the development of new concepts in museum practice and policy, including decolonisation and new museology. The course critically reflects on the role of museums in the colonisation process and its impact, and the role they can play within 20th and 21st century social justice movements. It will consider repatriation as a site of resistance and a means to disturb dominant narratives about curated heritage and its management. The course explores methods of community engagement and the ways that museums have produced internal and external change as exemplified in key repatriation/museum case studies. It consider the link between repatriation, healing, reconciliation and nation-building. Course themes are explored through consideration of a wide range of collecting institutions including the work of local community museums and heritage centres. Repatriation as a social movement is explored broadly, including through understanding of the return of knowledge, archives, audiovisual materials, cultural materials and ancestral remains. How legal and other regulatory instruments connect with/link museums and repatriation is investigated. From an Indigenous perspective, the course explores key terms such as 'justice' 'self-determination', 'heritage' and 'reconciliation' to problematise and understand the role and potential of repatriation, museums and community collections to contribute to advancing social justice for colonised peoples whose cultural and bodily remains became part of institutional collections in Australia and worldwide."

It creates a learning experience for students that requires self-reflective practices, consistent engagement and ethical engagement with content important to First Peoples.",
        "In this course we create opportunities for students to develop insight into First Nations and other Indigenous peoples' diverse perspectives on experiences since the British commenced colonisation of this continent, its islands, seas and peoples. Students will learn more about shared histories, and explore the systems and structures that have developed and their impacts of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, other Indigenous peoples, and reflect on how colonisation affects contemporary Australian society.",
        "We focus on selected significant events, reflect on the resilience and agency of First Peoples until now, and learn more about the context of resurgence. While focussing on the more recent shared past, this course creates an opportunity for students to develop insight in the deep past of this continent and its continuities, and reflect on the implications of that for contemporary issues over time, including the relations of First Peoples and settlers in the Australian state. Students will have an opportunity to learn about the lived reality of First Peoples' rights in Australia, and reflect upon this in a global context.",
        "This is an introductory course in Australian Indigenous Studies that centres First Peoples' diverse perspectives and that critically engages with scholarly and popular narratives about key events. Students will be introduced to methodologies in relation to standpoint, positionality and reflexivity, and research ethics and protocols. This course complements and interleaves with the other foundational course in Australian Indigenous Studies,INDG1001. These courses are designed to be taken in either order."

        "This intensive course will introduce students to critical issues in archival practice in a rapidly evolving and expanding terrain. The course has a particular focus on archives associated with First Nations peoples and, on particular the legacy of colonial era archives. The course will explore archive practice in the contest of repatriation and restitution, in conjunction with examining the history of archives from the sixteenth century. Students will experience archival culture firsthand: how and why archivists work and think across a broad range of institutions and they will engage directly with diverse types of archival material including institutional records, personal papers, material culture, as well as sound and audio-visual archives. The course focuses on examining the intellectual processes rather than the mechanistic practices of archiving. Students will consider specific theoretical and practical issues raised by particular forms of archive such as the politics of selection or silencing, colonisation and the archive, archive governance and ownership, the impact of digital technology, conceptual frameworks such as DIY archiving and so-called \u2018radical archives\u2019, as well as different approaches to curating, exhibiting and using archives. These theoretical issues will be practically demonstrated as students use archives to conduct provenancing exercises for repatriation and restitution initiatives. Students will also take advantage of the university\u2019s place in the national capital, this course will include field trips to major cultural institutions which could include the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies Archive, ANU Noel Butlin Archives or special collections, the National Library of Australia, the National Archives of Australia, the National Film and Sound Archive or the National Art Gallery of Australia and the National Museum of Australia. In addition to traditional physical archives, this course will also get students to examine digital archival practice using the Return Reconcile and Renew archive as well as other online archives. This course is of interest to students of museum and heritage studies, history, anthropology, art history, music and digital humanities."

The uncertain aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic, the rise - or return - of authoritarian great powers, the existential challenge presented by climate change, and depressingly frequent experiences of war, revolution and terrorism speak to high levels of global turbulence. This course examines a central element within this turbulent environment - movements around the world that seek to generate a different social order: national, international, global. These movements range from advocates of climate justice to militant Salafists. We examine their ideologies, tactics and goals, explore their similarities and differences, and assess their chances of success. Our overarching aim is to assess whether these movements are likely to intensify levels of global turbulence or whether they might help to generate a new world order."

        "Rome is best remembered today as the world of gladiators, back-stabbing politicians, and bloodthirsty soldiers. The course goes behind our modern myths and preconceptions to uncover the reality of Roman history, literature, and culture. This was a society that produced beautiful poetry such as Virgil's Aeneid and stunning works of art like the Dying Gaul, yet it was also a culture built on enslavement, conquest, and plunder. Rome evolved and expanded from one city on the Tiber River to an empire that stretched from Spain in the west to Syria in the east, from Germany in the north to Africa in the south. Rome's leaders and imperialistic ambitions have served as models both to celebrate and to reject monarchical rule and colonialism. It was a world that witnessed some of the most important transitions that have shaped the modern world, from the rise of Christianity to law and legal institutions. This course will explore Rome from multiple perspectives, from politicians and poets to pilgrims and pirates, paying attention to the voices of the enslaved, dispossessed, and exploited and acknowledging the rich cultural diversity of the territories ruled by Rome. We will not only study ancient texts and monuments but also later literary and artistic interpretations of the Roman world."

        "Even a cursory glance at daily headlines reveals a plethora of social and societal issues in which scientific evidence is a core component. Dig a little deeper and it becomes clear that scientific evidence is often misunderstood, misused, misappropriated or ignored, especially in public and political domains. The consequences of this can range from the merely quirky to the manifestly dangerous.Scientific evidence is increasingly wielded in arguments in the public domain, and the calls for \u2018evidenced based decisions\u2019 have never been so frequent, so broad, or so loud. To operate effectively in such an environment, today\u2019s science communicators must be able to tell the difference between good research and bad, even if that research falls beyond their personal scientific skillset and experience.They must possess the skills and knowledge to critique the evidence at the base of science-related issues affecting society today. In parallel, they need to understand, and be able to apply, science communication research to their own communication practice.This course emphasizes the analysis, critique and communication of science and scientific evidence in the context of identifying, understanding and critiquing examples of social influence and change.The course focuses on cases of critical societal challenges that have significant science bases such as\u2022 Climate change\u2022 Alternative energy\u2022 Public health (e.g., vitamin supplements, vaccination, homeopathic remedies)\u2022 Natural disaster mitigation and survival (e.g., bushfires, tsunamis)\u2022 Health and safety legislation (e.g., illicit drugs, road safety, GM foods)\u2022 The role of scientific research in society (e.g., curiosity driven versus applied)To be able to successfully appraise the relative merits of evidence, both for scientific and science communication research, students in this course will be exposed to the philosophy and reasoning behind common quantitative and qualitative methods and methodological argument.Scientific research, analysis and communication will be considered from the multiple, sometimes conflicting, perspectives of formal researchers, politicians, the media, and society at large."

National governments and multilateral agencies (e.g., the United Nations) have high expectations of technological solutions to major policy problems related to the economy, public health, education, energy, agriculture, environment, defence and more. Yet, novel technologies also demand government intervention such as regulation in the public good. Likewise, developments in scientific knowledge have paradoxical effects. Science may be expected to resolve political conflicts by providing incontrovertible evidence to underpin policy, but novel science may equally create new uncertainties and disagreement amongst experts.\u00a0Added to these challenges are emerging concerns about the ability of digital media to spread misinformation to the detriment of policy objectives.",

This requires context-specific research and knowledge acquisition. These projects will not necessarily be undertaken individually, and how students become involved in each other's projects will be an important exercise in negotiating different roles.

But what do demographers mean when they talk about sex difference? How do their concepts of sex and gender overlap with those from other disciplines, such as sociology? How do they deal with non-binary gender identities? Which sex differences exist in population processes and how are they being explained? And how are sex differences in demographic processes linked with gender inequalities in other areas of society?

Within federal configurations, power and resources can simultaneously shift downwards (towards local government) and upwards towards the center. Why would the center concede power to subnational units or vice versa? In this course, we will explore the logic of power-sharing and the motives (causes) that drive it from two different theoretical perspectives that are grounded in experience: rational choice (American) and historical institutionalism (European). In the final stages of the course we will begin to look at the impact (consequences) of federalism on democracy and democratic representation, economic stability, and redistribution. By doing so, we will be examining one of the most dynamic research areas at the intersection of political science and economics. We will examine both the normative theories of federalism and how it is applied in practice to countries such as Australia, Canada, and the US, and in emerging federations such as Brazil and Argentina. Australian federalism will be a focus of this course, and will provide students with a unique opportunity to propose real world solutions to real world policy challenges being faced in Australia."

        "This course provides a guide to the processes and methods of social research, with emphasis on qualitative rather than quantitative research, and on the kinds of research questions and environments that researchers are liable to encounter in development work. The research process can be considered to be divided into four phases: Formulating Research Questions (and dealing with research requests), Gathering Data, Analysing Data, and Writing Up. This course focuses especially on the Gathering Data phase. We will explore, and pay critical attention to, certain 'rapid assessment' methods and tools that have become standard in many kinds of development work in the last two to three decades. These tools are used to map or document the varied relationships between members of local communities and their environmental, social and cultural resources. We will explore the concept of 'participation' that underlies those tools. We will consider differences and similarities between these participatory development tools and standard anthropological methods. Throughout, we will keep in mind questions of research ethics, kinds of knowledge and observation, and the politics, conflicts and dynamics of research with and within local communities."

Topics include: the impact of colonialism, nationalism and the environment, plantation crises, land grabs, deforestation, decolonization, and the potential role of the postcolonial state in conflict and environmental degradation. We also use anthropological approaches to explore how indigenous knowledge and cultural traditions give rise to multispecies ethics and the kind of ideologies and activities that have inspired environmental activism.",

Subsequently, we will explore human health from a historical perspective, learning about the primary factors that have driven massive health improvements over the past century. Emphasis will be placed on the similarities, and differences, in these health transitions across high-, middle-, and low-income contexts. We will then explore the social and structural factors underlying health disparities both across populations and between individuals, including the roles of gender, wealth, educational attainment, occupation, ethnicity, and immigrant status. We will discuss emerging trends that threaten these continued improvements\u2014obesity, cardiovascular disease, smoking, drug overdose, and dementia. In these discussions, we will focus on the role of social relationships in affecting health, and the ways that inequality, social stigma, and biases can perpetuate detrimental health behaviours."

The social determinants of health are important from a public health perspective because they point to the causes of health risks and hence the necessary interventions; explain chronic disease policy failure; explain differentials in health outcomes; address questions posed in philosophy regarding pathways to equity and equality. The social determinants of health framework has been adopted by the World Health organisation and governments, and this course aims to supply an in-depth understanding of the field and its importance."

It also provides a grounding in the Cold War-era conflicts that shaped the region as we know it today. The central focus, however, is on contemporary internal armed conflict rooted in processes of state formation and state decay (for instance, ethnic conflict in Myanmar, separatist violence in Indonesia or the attempts to create an autonomous region in Muslim Mindanao in the Philippines). Key internal conflicts affecting the human security of millions of Southeast Asians, as well as near neighbours like Australia, will be analysed in their unique historical and cultural context, and related to cross-cutting questions with broad inter-disciplinary significance negotiating views from above and below, from inside and outside."

        "In this course we examine speculative and critical design methodologies which challenge the narrow assumptions and preconceptions that typically limit the form and function of designed artefacts. These methodologies look beyond a functional instrumentalism to consider how design can be used to incite mindful reflection rather than blind consumption, as well as address society\u2019s \u201cwicked problems\u201d. The processes and practices considered involve designers imagining futures based on current technological and cultural trajectories; but rather than accepting those trajectories, design is used as an instrument to incite change and alter their direction. The course uses design projects as the main vehicle for the exploration of speculative design theories and methodologies. The projects are not confined to any particular medium or discipline but require students to question what they produce and why."

Yet state building is itself a deeply violent process. Moreover the state continues to be a prolific user of violence. Aside from the obvious case of war between states, both democratic and authoritarian states engage in varying levels of everyday violence. In some cases, this violence is perceived as legitimate, as in the use of imprisonment as a punishment for criminal activity. In other cases, states transgress norms of legitimate violence, engaging in activities such as torture, sexual violence, and even ethnic cleansing. This course will cover topics including state building, torture, civil war, and crime and punishment. We will read work from political science, political economy, political sociology and political theory. This is a reading intensive seminar."

There have been, and continue to be, wars between states, civil wars within states and terrorist outrages that have shaken the very foundations of the nation state. Modern conflict is characterised by new weapons, new technologies, new environments in which to fight and new kinds of participants in the hostilities. The emerging, increasingly fragmented and rapidly changing notion of conflict challenges, and is challenged by, a body of international law that seems to have difficulty in adapting to these new developments.",

        "This course exists for three reasons. First, it introduces students to the leading concepts that sit at the heart of Strategic Studies and allows them to study these in real depth. Second, the course examines how these ideas can be applied in the \u2018real world\u2019 of strategy, especially in terms of conflict issues in the Asia-Pacific. And third, given that most of these concepts were developed \u2013 or, at the very least, took on new meaning - during the 1950s and 1960s at the height of the Cold War, the course also critically analyses how well they apply today in a much different cultural, geographic and temporal setting. Do they usefully illuminate contemporary Asia-Pacific conflict and how this might work out? Or are adapted and possibly even new versions of these strategic concepts needed as this region enters an era of deepening strategic competition?"

        "For Australians, Taiwan typically figures only as an issue in the geo-politics of the East Asian region, as one half of \u201cCross-Strait Relations\u201d. Yet, it is a fully functioning democracy and an independent state in all but name that can be studied in its own right. Taiwan has almost the same population as Australia but is about half the size of Tasmania. Like Australia, its indigenous population plays a significant part in politics and society, and Taiwan is also moving towards legalising same-sex marriage. This course provides an overview of contemporary Taiwan\u2019s society and politics while also paying attention to the historical events that formed its present shape and which remain live issues today. It will analyse Taiwan\u2019s political system and its established and new parties; its ethnic, linguistic and cultural mix; its economics and class relations; indigenous politics; questions of gender and sexuality; environmental activism; and the growing sense of what it means to be \u201cTaiwanese\u201d. The course will use Taiwanese films to supplement the lectures and seminars."

We will do so through closely reading a selection of case studies, moving from the 1950s' 'I Love Lucy' through to 'The Simpsons', 'Twin Peaks' and to a contemporary film that is arguably inspired by contemporary televisual media (Richard Linklater's 'Boyhood'). In doing so, we will engage with some of the twentieth- and twenty-first centuries\u2019 most important theorists of television narrative (including Raymond Williams and Marshall McLuhan). Beginning with television\u2019s first emergence in the 1950s, we will consider the various ways in which television has been produced, transmitted and received. Our investigation will move from television's reliance on studio recording to thinking about the importance of live and cable broadcasting and, more recently, the role of digital devices that can stream or download content. We will ask questions about what makes televisual storytelling distinct and whether or not television has influenced the development of other forms (including novels and films). The course will conclude with our looking at how television has transformed in the contemporary era of so-called convergent or \u2018connexionist\u2019 media."

China's domestic economic reforms and integration into the global economy raise countless questions about the nature of China's economic growth and development process in the past, present, and future:\u00a0Has China's transition from central planning to an increasingly market-based economy been successful? What kind of capitalist system is China becoming, if becoming capitalist at all? What are the major challenges facing the current generation of leaders under President Xi Jinping, and what are the prospects for inclusive economic growth in the future? How has China been transformed by, and in turn transformed, the global economy and how are other nations responding to these twin transformations?",

This\u00a0course provides students with sufficient foundational awareness of intelligence issues to enable them to critically evaluate the utility of 21st century espionage and thus anticipate its evolution. The course will focus on future-oriented intelligence issues, notably the rise of open source intelligence and big data analytics, the democratisation of signals intelligence and geospatial-intelligence capabilities once monopolised by the state, the ubiquity of cyber, the collapsing distinction between domestic and foreign intelligence, growing public transparency expectations, and the challenge to 20th century intelligence-sharing alignments, especially the Five Eyes. In line with the NSC signature pedagogy and drawing on the NSC\u2019s network of senior former intelligence officials, practitioner perspectives will be integrated throughout where possible, with the academic convener connecting their insights to the growing scholarly literature on 21st century spying."

The idea that law should regulate what is done in war may seem strange but is well accepted. Accordingly, the law determines which targets may be attacked and which classes of person and object must be protected. Some persons and objects are specially protected, and it is vitally important that all involved understand what these rules provide.",

        "While local governments have traditionally been thought of as relatively powerless and administrative in nature, this has been rapidly changing. In recent years, many local governments around the world have jumped headfirst into a range of complex and controversial policy debates that were previously reserved for national governments. In some notable instances, local governments, and the cities they represent, have even taken the lead in addressing some of today\u2019s most pressing political, economic, and environmental challenges \u2013 from climate change, economic inequality, to political polarization. For many policy analysts and commentators, this change in local government ambition is not just the result of greater decentralization, but represents one key part of a larger \u2018localist revolution\u2019 that now holds the potential to transform contemporary urban governance, local citizenship, and community resilience for the better.",
        "This course introduces students to the emerging new localism that many local government leaders, representatives, and policymakers are embracing. Drawing on applied case studies from around the world, students will analyse and reflect on how local governments in different jurisdictions are working together with a range of governmental and non-governmental actors to influence and solve complex public policy challenges in their communities. In particular, students will examine how different models of local and hyperlocal governance, municipalism, place stewardship, local activism, and community wealth building can aid in reimagining politics at the bottom of the federal hierarchy and, in so doing, elevate local institutions and capabilities over centralised forms of power. Through this, the course aims to provide students with a nuanced understanding of the potential and limitations of contemporary local governance as well as a practical toolkit that they can use to engage local communities to solve their own problems and challenges."

From blowing glass, spinning pottery and casting bronze statues, to strumming the lyre, staging a tragedy, and devising ancient automata, students will gain an understanding of the processes and societal functions of the arts and technology in ancient Greece and Rome. Fundamental to this topic are questions surrounding the ambivalence of attitudes towards technical pursuits (techne) in antiquity, the status of craftspeople, and the potential of the arts both to reflect and to shape societal values. Various hands-on components\u2014including physical engagement with ancient objects and off-site excursions to explore manufacturing techniques\u2014make this course especially exciting for students from different disciplinary backgrounds.

        "This advanced undergraduate course introduces students to major strands of philosophical research in the field of gender. In particular, the course examines feminist epistemology, which has had a wide-ranging influence; feminist discourses on power that seek to interpret gendered phenomena in public and private contexts; and theories of the nature and reality of gender. Philosophers have been among the leading theorists of gender (Simone de Beauvoir, Judith Butler, Elizabeth Grosz, for instance) and have advanced important theories of knowledge and power to which gendered relations are central. By paying attention to the explicitly philosophical context from which our most influential accounts of gender arise, students will gain depth and subtlety in their capacity to interpret the nuances of gendered realities.",
        "This course will therefore be of interest to students with a background or interest in gender studies as well as to philosophers. It encourages students to think about the complexities of gender, gendered relations, embodiment, inequality and power as these impact how we understand wider questions of social and political order. By philosophically exploring gender as an aspect of knowledge, self-hood, social institutions, and political hierarchy, students will be well placed to critically evaluate key debates around gender in the contemporary world."

Storytellers and their audiences claim identity and status, encode their values, sacralise world-views and imagine alternative ways of being through narratives: stories shape lives and cultures.\u00a0Through studying the narrative traditions of the interconnected regions of South and Southeast Asia, we will think about how stories are used to interpret and create cultural ideas of geography, religion, gender, social identity, and much more. In this two-week intensive course (with follow up research assessments), students will learn to interpret and analyse narrative traditions from a wide variety of sources (folktales, legends, myths, epics, oral histories, film/television, online media, etc.). While we focus on South and Southeast Asian sources in English translation, the skills and techniques learned in this course can be used to understand cultures globally and provide invaluable tools for anyone seeking to understand cultural identities in the contemporary world."

It explores the nature and character of war, the characteristics of land, sea and air power, and how they might be used to achieve policy ends. In doing so it will examine the pitfalls and risks of military endeavour, the possible benefits, and what military forces can and cannot do. It will also consider the relationship between strategy, operations and tactics, the challenge of political-military relationships, military command systems and how militaries plan operations.

Students will engage in depth in the analysis of the social and psychological process of social categorization into groups, the interdependencies between individuals and groups, and the cognitive, attitudinal and behavioural consequences of both social categorization and social interdependence. Throughout the course, students will have the opportunity to examine current understandings of group interactions (e.g., deviance, norms, & decision making), pro-social behaviours (e.g., cooperation, helping, trust, & fairness), social change and collective action, social influence, and stereotyping and prejudice. The course, itself, strongly integrates theory with laboratory and field data, allowing students to gain a solid understanding of advanced, contemporary insights into a range of social behaviours.",

Throughout the course, students will design an experiment; complete a Human Research Ethics Application; and write a formal research report Introduction, hypothesis, Methods and Results. Students will learn key features of social-psychological experimental design, including the manipulation and measurement of variables of interest, scale construction, hypothesis testing, data interpretation, as well as abstract methodological concepts such as \u201cmediation\u201d and \u201cmoderation\u201d.",

        "In October 1917, a small band of Marxist revolutionaries called the Bolsheviks seized control of the largest country in the world, Russia, and declared they were building a new civilization. Just before its collapse in 1991, this \u201ccivilization\u201d encompassed a third of the globe and its shadow continues to frame, indeed, haunt munch of it. How did this small band of radicals achieve this remarkable goal? This course traces how the Bolsheviks maintained and expanded their rule through civil war, rapid industrialization, colossal loss of life to famine and terror, Nazi invasion and the Cold War before the Soviet Empire collapsed in a remarkably bloodless dissolution in 1991. Some of the questions the course asks include: What was Communism and how did it triumph? How did the Bolsheviks go about creating their new civilization in an ancient and multiethnic Empire and then across the world? Who opposed them and what happened to them? What was life like before, under and after Stalin? Did a regime that had withstood civil war, invasion and cold war simply resign itself so meekly to the dustbin of history in 1991, as many thought at the time, or has more recent developments in Russia, Ukraine and the former Soviet space cast doubt on this thesis?"

        "Speakers and writers organise the elements of the English language to convey messages which can be instantly decoded by listeners or by readers. We investigate the elements of grammar (syntax and morphology), as well as exploring connections between grammar and meaning (semantics). We begin with the grammar of Standard Modern English, learning terms and analytical techniques which linguists use to study and describe grammar. The structural characteristics of English are compared with those of other languages. We then examine variation in English, including regional dialects, social and stylistic variation.\u00a0 Special attention is paid to 'new Englishes'\u00a0 which are varieties of English that exist alongside other languages in bi- or multilingual contexts such as in Singapore or India.Note: While the course is not aimed at improving the English of non-native speakers, students with English as a second language should find that this course will improve their understanding of the workings of the language at a deep level and have practical effects in helping them to eliminate systematic errors in their English.\u00a0 These students as well as native speakers of English will learn metalanguage which will be of assistance to them in understanding and acting on constructive criticisms made by teachers on the language of their essays and other writing."

The thesis should be an extended argument addressing an intellectual question, problem or issue. The skills that are required to write a good thesis build on those developed through essay writing for other courses.

It might try to develop a new theory about well-known evidence. A major part of the thesis writing process is establishing what research question to ask and how to go about answering that question. The thesis should be an extended argument addressing an intellectual question, problem or issue. The skills that are required to write a good thesis build on those developed through essay writing for other courses. The main difference is that for the thesis the student takes the lead in identifying their research puzzle, articulating a question and developing an argument based on research they have carried out by themselves.

The Semester 1 iteration of the course will focus on guiding students through the initial research and writing of a portion of their own thesis project. This will involve three elements: 1) locating and evaluating secondary material relevant to their topic; 2) developing a critical framework which is appropriate for the discussion and analysis of their primary text/s (whether poetry, fiction, drama, film, or other cultural texts); and 3) drafting and revising a section of the thesis itself. The Semester 2 iteration of the course will build on the skills developed in Semester 1, continuing to provide a space where students can share, present on, and workshop portions of their thesis across the second half of the honours year. It will help students to collectively troubleshoot elements of their thesis writing; refine their research skills and argumentative structure and their skills at professionally presenting their work. Through each stage of the process students will exchange their work with their peers for discussion and feedback.

        "Metaphysics is the study of the fundamental nature of reality, and epistemology is the study of the nature of knowledge. This course is about the social aspects of those fields. In the first half of the course, on social metaphysics, we\u2019ll ask what socially constructed categories are, and whether or not they\u2019re \u201creal.\u201d We\u2019ll learn methods for working out answers to questions like, What is race?, What is gender?, and What is disability? We\u2019ll also look at a range of answers to those questions, including some Indigenous perspectives, and whether we should get rid of some social categories altogether; for example, some people have argued that we\u2019re better off without the concept of race.",
        "In the section on social epistemology, we\u2019ll start by learning some leading views of what knowledge is and what it takes for a belief to be justified. We\u2019ll then look at knowledge and justification in social contexts. Questions we\u2019ll investigate include: Should you ever believe something\u2019s morally right or wrong just because someone tells you it is? When people as informed and smart as us disagree with us, should we change our beliefs? How does culture relate to knowledge? For example, many philosophers say that philosophy is an exclusively Western phenomenon; are they right? How do you know when what you\u2019re being told is propaganda, and is propaganda always a bad thing? Throughout the course, we\u2019ll examine how the topics we\u2019ll discuss relate to important issues in public policy and the social sciences.",
        "Analytic philosophy is the dominant style of philosophy in the English-speaking world, characterised by its emphasis on clarity and rigor in the analysis of concepts and arguments. The traditional core areas of analytic philosophy include metaphysics (focused on issues about the fundamental nature of reality), epistemology (focused on issues about knowledge), philosophy of language, and philosophy of mind. This course will introduce you to the central issues in one or more of these traditional core areas of analytic philosophy. The precise topics will change from year to year. By the end of this course, you will both understand the key philosophical concepts, theories, and arguments covered in the course, and also learn how to apply the analytic rigor characteristic of this work to your own writing and argumentation.",

It introduces students to different conceptualisations of transformation \u2013 social-ecological, structural and enabling frameworks \u2013 and outlines practical principles for effective research and action towards sustainability.\u00a0Students learn to connect critical conceptual (theoretical) readings with practical examples, explore how environmental issues arise in different contexts, and consider openings for intervention through cases where these approaches are applied. Students also explore particular environmental problems in small groups and develop an analysis of a specific problem of their choosing, assessing opportunities and constraints facing different strategies to address the issue. In each section of the course, students will consider the advantages and disadvantages of each conceptual approach to transformations, considering how the approaches might be combined to drive socio-environmental transformations."

        "Sociological debates in recent decades have reinvigorated the question of the relevance of sociological knowledge. In debates around \u2018Public Sociology\u2019, for example, it has been suggested that sociology has surrendered its original mission of positively transforming society. In this course, we will critically engage with such debates, exploring the status of sociological knowledge with respect to the past, present, and future. We will explore the colonial assumptions underpinning the dominant model of sociology\u2019s public (moral) mission. How might we think about progressive change when the very idea of progress is a product of histories of dominance and violence? How is sociology\u2019s sense of itself as a scientific representation of the empirical present challenged by the production of so-called big data? How might we think about our future role in social transformation in view of the increasing popularity of new, transdisciplinary models of problem solving? What are the differences between social transformation and social innovation?",

The variation in these trajectories\u2014in their cultural origins and in their content\u2014can make their crossings unpredictable and explosive and often unintelligible. This course will explore with students the claims and negotiations that are fundamental to some of the critical debates in Indian history and politics over the past two centuries. In particular it will aim to alert students to the possibility that underlying these contentious events, ideas and processes are contending claims to truth and authenticity.The course will focus on a set of truth claims that constitute the interface of cultural interactions within India and between Indian cultures and the rest of the world: stereotypes, stories, histories, myths, corruption and claims to authenticity and ethnicity. Such a study of India, by facilitating the study of cultural interactions through the prism of different configurations of truth and falsity, rather than the prism of power, will also encourage students to think more broadly and deeply about the interplay between notions of truth."

The variation in these trajectories\u2014in their cultural origins and in their content\u2014can make their crossings unpredictable and explosive and often unintelligible. This course will explore with students the claims and negotiations that are fundamental to some of the critical debates in Indian history and politics over the past two centuries. In particular it will aim to alert students to the possibility that underlying these contentious events, ideas and processes are contending claims to truth and authenticity.",

Such a study of India, by facilitating the study of cultural interactions through the prism of different configurations of truth and falsity, rather than the prism of power, will also encourage students to think more broadly and deeply about the interplay between notions of truth."

The capacity to make choices is often described as the most fundamental feature of humanity: In many contemporary social theory texts free will - the ability to become an agentive subject and choose between different courses of action - is what defines the human condition. In this course we will critically interrogate this assumption by turning it on its head. By deploying a number of anthropological angles, we will move beyond simplistic depictions of human nature as fundamentally good or evil, instead trying to make sense of the complex and often violent dynamics that impinge on people\u2019s autonomy and self-determination. We will use unfreedom as a prism to shed light on historical and contemporary forms of subjugation, including slavery, domestication, debt and many others. The course will provide the conceptual and empirical tools to examine how unfreedom manifests across diverse social, political, cultural and economic contexts. Throughout the course, we will pay close attention to diverse experiences of unfreedom, as well as examining it as a form of social engineering. The first half of the course will be dedicated to identifying and discussing key concepts anthropologists have developed to address forms of subjection, imprisonment and enslavement.

        "Urban energy and energy efficiency will be placed in context in respect of demographic and social trends in Australia and worldwide, energy delivery economics, greenhouse gas emissions, energy storage, transport systems and the rapidly increasing use of renewable energy and electrical energy storage. Rapid changes are occurring in urban energy systems, driven by falling prices for photovoltaic (PV) systems and storage, and concerns over greenhouse gas emissions. Roof-mounted PV systems are strongly competing with electricity from the grid and with gas for provision of water heating, space heating & cooling, and electrical services. Heat pumps, thermal storage, battery storage, smart electrical energy controllers, energy-efficient appliances and solar-efficient buildings are facilitating a rapid change in energy use patterns in buildings and factories. Electric cars and public transport have the potential rapidly to change urban transport systems and transport energy use patterns.",

        "The Victorian period was one of extraordinary achievement and activity in the literary field, fostered by increasing literacy rates, the expansion of circulating libraries and a proliferation of weekly periodicals, all of which served to make literature more accessible as the nineteenth century progressed. In this course we will read a variety of Victorian texts in the context of nineteenth-century anxieties and discourses about sexual transgression, gender roles, disease, madness, spiritualism, the experience of modernity and the problem of the body. We will read a range of literary forms including novels, novellas, short stories, plays and poetry, and both canonical and non-canonical texts, enabling us to understand the breadth of Victorian writers' achievement and the way that Victorian literature both participated in and emerged from debates in other cultural discourses such as medicine, psychology, sociology and philosophy. The inclusion of texts from other areas of Europe, Australia and America may provide the opportunity to test the connotations and the limits of the term \"Victorian\" as a lens through which to study the output of this productive period.",
        "In this course, students will attend weekly lectures and tutorials. Lectures are 2 hours long and focus on a range of Victorian texts along with critical and contextual ideas related to the study of these texts. Tutorials are 1  hour long and offer students the opportunity to discuss the key texts and critical readings that are set for each week. The assessments for the course give students the opportunity to showcase their research, critical thinking and writing skills. This will typically take the form of two major essays, one submitted before the mid-semester break and one submitted towards the end of semester. There is also a tutorial participation component which assesses students on their engagement with the primary texts and related critical materials, as well as their contributions to class via discussion and active listening."

        "The course combines research-based teaching by the conveners and guest lecturers with interactive learning activities. Over two weeks, participants will be encouraged to use their knowledge and experiences as a foundation for exploring diverse perspectives of \u2018water justice\u2019 in order to develop their capability to work in transdisciplinary fields. Students are invited to construct their own understanding of \u2018water justice\u2019 by interpreting the literature and, where relevant, contextualising it within their own experience of water injustice. Students will have the opportunity to gain insights into First Nations\u2019 perspectives through the course readings and, when available, guest lectures. At the end of the course, students will be able to apply critical thinking skills to critique water management frameworks and policies."

This course dives into the complex factors that have fuelled wars throughout history and continue to threaten international security today. Through a blend of theoretical insights and in-depth historical case studies, students will explore the multifaceted causes of international conflicts, from geopolitical tensions and resource scarcity to ideological clashes and beyond. Each week, we will unravel a different theoretical perspective on the origins of international conflict, illuminated by an in-depth case study examination of an international conflict (or major crisis averted short of war). The course is designed to be highly interactive. Students will immerse themselves in simulations that replicate real international crises, engage in debates that challenge their perspectives, and participate in exercises that foster critical thinking and policy analysis skills. This practical approach ensures that theoretical and historical knowledge is each week applied to a contemporary challenge, preparing students for international security career paths."

It was the defining event in the history of the twentieth century. This comparative, transnational survey will focus on the political, social and cultural aspects of this conflict, and working with diverse historical materials and perspectives. It will deal with the war in Europe, Africa, Asia and the Pacific, addressing topics including: German and Japanese war aims; Blitzkrieg in Poland and France; propaganda, civilian mobilisation and total war; allied leadership, co-operation and division; civilians under occupation (collaboration and resistance) and the experience of prisoners of war; racial policies and genocide; wartime intelligence and espionage; the debates over mass bombing and recourse to atomic weapons; and concepts of post-war reconstruction and the emergence of new international institutions. We will survey the contexts and legacies of the war, and evaluate its enduring historical significance."

From the Gutenberg Press to ChatGPT, technology has always had a profound impact on how we write, what we write, and how writing is circulated and read. This course introduces theoretical conceptions of publishing, authorship, and textuality. These concepts lay the foundations for understanding important contemporary debates about the impact of technology on writing and literature. This includes crucial discussions of authenticity, originality, commercialisation, and platformisation. Students will apply these theories and develop a deeper understanding of these debates through analysis of new digital forms of writing, and literary works that engage deeply with the relationship between writing and old and new technologies."
